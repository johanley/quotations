Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|In the 20th century we have passed through a unique period, one in which architecture as a discipline has been in a state that is almost unimaginably bad. Sometimes I think of it as a mass psychosis of unprecedented dimension, in which the people of earth - in large numbers and in almost all contemporary societies - have created a form of architecture which is against life, insane, image-ridden, hollow.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|For twenty years, I spent two or three hours a day looking at pairs of things... comparing them, and asking myself: em(Which has more life?)
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|What I am proposing is that these observations of an observer's inner state are not merely a reflection of a person's attitude or psychology, but can actually be used to measure something real about the external world em(itself).
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|Can it really be true that something as elusive as freedom - and perhaps even the deeper capacity to be human - depends in some way on the environment?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Living structure in buildings can only be em(generated). It cannot be created by brute force from designs... the building - its conception, plan design, detailed layout, structural design, and material detail are all unfolded, step by step in time.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Insofar as unfolded buildings are lovable, what we love about them is not their age but the rightness which we experience in them. This rightness got into them em(as a result of a step-by-step unfolding process). We can see and feel the rightness. And we see it and feel it because it has a different geometric character from the character which is created by "design".
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The step-by-step approach works. The all-or-nothing does not work. This is the secret of biological evolution... It would be impossible for nature to "design" a system as complex as an organism all at once.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|As any designer will tell you, it is the first steps in a design process which count for most. The first few strokes, which create the form, carry within them the destiny of the rest.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|It is essential to form this vision of the emerging building em(in your mind's eye), not in sketches on paper. Words and interior visions, when seen with your eyes closed, are more labile, more fluid, transformable, and three-dimensional, than sketches or physical designs.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|...to prune a design, and look at it over and over again, searching for any little parts that are not centers - and then work at it, compressing, cutting, simplifying, re-arranging, until every single part, and every part of every part, and every part between the parts are all centers. This is tremendously hard work.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The single most important thing that happens during the process of making anything, is the ever watchful task of getting the next bit of sequence right and modifying it as we go along. Paying attention to what has to be done next, and getting this right, is as important as what one actually does. The more one understands the idea of unfolding, and the more one understands the key role which sequence plays in the unfolding process, the more it becomes clear that the process of design and the process of construction are inseparable.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|We aim, by the end, to remove all extraneous structure. What we want is to cut and cut and cut until there is almost nothing left.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Simplicity is the state in which all structure is removed, except exactly that structure which is required.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|You know the em(feeling) which the thing will have. But you do em(not) know the em(form). In fact, you keep having to change the form, because as the work unfolds, you find out many, many details which have the wrong feeling, which do not function, in response to the whole, as you thought they would. Because you keep the em(feeling) constant, you em(have) to change the form.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|It is em(feeling), above all, which has the greatest chance of dealing with the whole in a balanced way, because it is precisely the nature of feeling that it does embrace the whole - while intellectual ideas more often concentrate on parts and end up getting them out of proportion.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Most present-day architects like em(talking) about construction, but are afraid of construction tools, and have little feeling for them. In many cases, getting their hands dirty scares them.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The gradual rubbing together of phenomena to get the right result, the slow process of getting things right, is almost unknown to us today.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|In our century the loss of control and loss of belonging started with the car.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|...making even tiny changes too casually can be damaging.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|What an extreme comment on the state of the world: that people should weep, merely because they are allowed to sketch on paper the apartment layout that they wanted for their family.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|Go into your mind's eye pretending to walk through the building, as if it existed already, but you are seeing it for the first time, and are stunned by its beauty. Your are genuinely surprised. You find yourself stunned by the beauty of the rooms. And you ask yourself, then, which features of what I am seeing, are making it so beautiful?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|What will generate tranquility? The essence of it is pretty simple, but requires much concentration. Stand in the place. Ask yourself what you should put there - a certain stone on the mantel, a color on a piece of wall, the shape of an opening. For any of these, you ask, does it generate greater tranquility in me? If it does, keep it. If it does not, reject it. Keep on doing that, for everything around you. And then, get rid of everything else.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|...the underlying design vocabulary of the 20th century, almost throughout the century, asserted that designers should create structures that are "interesting", "pleasing", "fantastic", "exhilarating", "with elan", and so on - anything but em(beautiful). em(That) word has unalterable meaning, cannot be contaminated, and during the temporary insanity of the 20th century, struck a nerve which people could not tolerate.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|What is the reason for this "food-like" character of the making process? Why should it matter so much, whether a person makes something beautiful or not? Why should it have such a profound effect on the maker?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|In order to create living structure, we must please ourselves....And you need em(only) please yourself. But you must please yourself em(truly).
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|It is very, very hard to make a beautiful building.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|I try to shape the volume such that its volume brings tears to my throat...This sadness of tears, when I reach it, is also joy.
Christopher Alexander|The Timeless Way of Building|Here there is no mastery of unnameable creative processes: only the patience of a craftsman, chipping away slowly; the mastery of what is made does not lie in the depths of some impenetrable ego; it lies, instead, in the simple mastery of the steps in the process, and in the definition of these steps.
Christopher Alexander|The Timeless Way of Building|The simple process by which people generate a living building, simply by walking it out, waving their arms, thinking together, placing stakes in the ground, will always touch them deeply.

Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|...ordinary reading, slow and uniform, strikes them [digital natives] as incompatible, alien. It isn't just boring and obsolete. It's irritating.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Few things are worse for adolescent minds than overblown appraisals of their merits.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|The more mentors have engaged youth in youth terms, though, the more youth have disengaged from the mentors themselves and from the culture they are supposed to represent.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|The 18-year-old may have a Visa card, cell phone, My Space page, part-time job, Play Station 2, and an admissions letter to State U., but ask this wired and on-the-go high school senior a few intellectual questions and the facade of in-the-knowness crumbles.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|For all their technological adroitness, they don't read or write or divide very well.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Fully 45 percent of the students just don't think leisure reading is important ("a little" or "not at all"). Unconvinced of what adult readers feel deep in their hearts and know from long experience, nearly half of the student body disregards books by choice and disposition, and they don't expect to suffer for it. In their minds, a-literacy and anti-intellectualism pose no career obstacles, and they have no shame attached.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|How serenely this undergrad announces the transfer from "the whole book thing" to the Internet, as if the desertion of a civilization's principal storehouse merits little more than a shrug.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|In an average young person's online experience, the senses may be stimulated and the ego touched, but vocabulary doesn't expand, memory doesn't improve, analytic talents don't develop, and erudition doesn't ensue.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|If the guardians of tradition claim that the young, though ignorant, have a special perspective on the past, or if teachers prize the impulses of tenth-graders more than the thoughts of the wise and the works of the masters, learning loses its point. The thread of intellectual inheritance snaps.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Over the years, the indulgence of youth circulated among educators and settled into sanctioned pedagogy with a predictable result: not an unleashing of independent, creative, skeptical mental energies of rising students, but what we have seen in previous chapters, routine irreverence and knowledge deficits.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|In 1959, political philosopher Leo Strauss defined liberal education as "the counter-poison to mass culture". A history professor who agrees with this view today becomes a fuddy-duddy in his own department.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Spend some hours in school zones and you see that the indulgent attitude toward youth, along with the downplaying of tradition, has reached the point of dogma among teachers, reporters, researchers, and creators in arts and humanitarian fields, and pro-knowledge, pro-tradition conceptions strike them as bluntly unpleasant, if not reactionary and out of touch.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Confidence and enjoyment don't guarantee better students. Furthermore, they prevent the students from forming one of the essential ingredients of long-term success: an accurate, realistic appraisal of their present capacities.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|A predictable descent commenced. The sixties generation's leaders didn't anticipate how their claim of exceptionalism would affect the next generation, and the next, but the sequence was entirely logical. Informed rejection of the past became uninformed rejection of the past, and then the complete and unworried ignorance of it.

Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|This artificial method of communicating thought, we now behold carried to the highest perfection. Language is become a vehicle by which the most delicate and refined emotions of one mind can be transmitted, or, if we may so speak, transfused into another. Not only are names given to all objects around us, by which means an easy and speedy intercourse is carried on for providing the necessaries of life, but all the relations and differences among these objects are minutely marked, the invisible sentiments of the mind are described, the most abstract notions and conceptions are rendered intelligible; and all the ideas which science can discover, or imagination create, are known by their proper names... The object is become familiar; and, like the expanse of the firmament, and other great objects, which we are accustomed to behold, we behold it without wonder.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|And hence, if our Language, by reason of the simple arrangement of its words, possesses less harmony, less beauty, and less force, than the Greek or Latin; it is, however, in its meaning, more obvious and plain.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|...we must not forget to observe, that spoken language has a great superiority over written language, in point of energy or force. The voice of the living speaker makes impression on the mind, much stronger than can be made by the perusal of any writing.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|em(It), is the most general term that can possibly be conceived, as it may stand for any one thing in the universe of which we speak.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The Greek, which is the most perfect of all the known tongues, is very regular and complete in all the moods and tenses. The Latin, though formed on the same model, is not so perfect; particularly in the passive voice, which forms most of the tenses, by the help of the auxiliary "sum".
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|It [French] is, perhaps, the happiest language for conversation, in the known world; but on the higher subjects of composition, the English may be justly esteemed greatly to excel it considerably.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|Perspicuity, it will be readily admitted, is the fundamental quality of Style; a quality so essential in every kind of Writing, that for the want of it, nothing can atone. Without this, the richest ornaments of Style only glimmer through the dark; and puzzle instead of pleasing the reader. This, therefore, must be our first object, to make our meaning clearly and fully understood, and understood without the least difficulty. "Discourse" says Quintilian, "ought always to be obvious, oven to the most careless and negligent hearer, so that the sense shall strike his mind, as the light of the sun does our eyes, though they are not directed upwards to it. We must study, not only that every hearer may understand us, but that it shall be impossible for him not to understand us."
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|We are pleased with an author, we consider him as deserving praise, who frees us from all fatigue of searching for his meaning; who carries us through his subject without any embarrassment or confusion; whose style flows always like a limpid stream, where we see to the very bottom.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|A multitude of Latin words have of late been poured in upon us.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The words which a man uses to express his ideas, may be faulty in three respects; they may either not express that idea which the author intends, but some other which only resembles, or is akin to it; or, they may express that idea, but not quite fully and completely; or, they may express it, together with something more than he intends. Precision stands opposed to all these three faults; but chiefly to the last.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The use and importance of Precision, may be deduced from the nature of the human mind. It never can view, clearly and distinctly, above one object at a time.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|Thought and language act and re-act upon each other mutually. Logic and rhetoric have here, as in many other cases, a strict connexion; and he that is learning to arrange his sentences with accuracy and order, is learning, at the same time, to think with accuracy and order...

Mme Campan|Mémoires|Voici un trait vraiment touchant qu'on raconte du jeune dauphin que la mort nous a enlevé. Ce prince étant tombé en langeur de la maladie dont il est mort, avait toujours témoigné beaucoup d'affection à M. de Bourset, son valet de chambre. Il lui demanda un jour des ciseaux; ce gentilhomme lui représenta que cela lui était défendu. L'enfant insista avec douceur, et l'on fut obligé de lui céder. Muni des ciseaux qu'il désirait, il s'en servit pour se couper une boucle de cheveux qu'il enveloppa avec soin dans une feuille de papier: "Tenez, Monsieur, dit-il à son valet de chambre, voilà le seul présent que je puisse vous faire, n'ayant rien à ma disposition; mais quand je serai mort, vous présenterez ce gage à mon papa et à maman; en se souvenant de moi, j'espère qu'ils se souviendront de vous."

Mme Campan|Mémoires|C'était particulièrement contre la reine que l'insurrection était dirigée: je frémis encore en me souvenant que les poissardes, ou plutôt les furies qui portaient des tabliers blancs, criaient qu'ils étaient destinés à recevoir les entrailles de Marie-Antoinette; qu'elles s'en feraient des cocardes, et mêlaient les expressions les plus obscènes à ces horribles menaces; tant l'ignorance et la cruauté, qui se trouvent dans le masse de presque tous les peuples, peuvent dans les temps de troubles leur inspirer des sentiments atroces!
Mme Campan|Mémoires|Le chevalier de Dampierre avait été tué près de la voiture du roi, en sortant de Varennes. Un pauvre curé de village, à quelques lieues de l'endroit où ce crime venait d'être commis, eut l'imprudence de s'approcher pour parler au roi; les cannibales qui environnaient la voiture se jettent sur lui. "Tigres, leur cria Barnave, avez-vous cessé d'être Français? Nation de braves, êtes-vous devenue un peuple d'assassins?..." Ces seules paroles sauvèrent d'une mort certaine le curé déjà terrassé. Barnave, en les prononçant, s'était jeté presque hors la portière, et madame Élisabeth, touchée de ce noble élan, le retenait par la basque de son habit.
Mme Campan|Mémoires|La grande piété de madame Élisabeth donnaient à ses actions et à ses discours une noblesse qui peignait celle de son ame. Le jour où l'on immola cette digne descendante de saint Louis, le bourreau, en lui attachant les mains derrière le dos, releva une des pointes du devant de son fichu. Madame Élisabeth, avec un calme et une voix qui semblait ne pas venir de la terre, lui dit ces mots: "Au nom de la pudeur, couvrez-moi le sein." J'ai appris ce trait héroïque de madame de Sérilly, condamnée le même jour que la princesse, mais qui obtint un sursis au moment de l'exécution, madame de Montmorin, sa parente, ayant déclaré que sa cousine était grosse.

Joseph Conrad|Nostromo|The priest's inquisitional instincts suffered but little from the want of classical apparatus of the Inquisition.
Joseph Conrad|Nostromo|There is no credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness, which, in its universal extent, measures the moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly|Flow|I developed a theory of optimal experience based on the concept of em(flow) - the state in which people are so involved in an activity that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.
Mihaly Csikszentmihaly|Flow|Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person's capacity to act.

Theodore Dalrymple|Our Culture, What's Left Of It|One of them [photos of British life during the war] was ever present in my mind when I entered a bomb shelter with my friends: that of two young children, both blind, their sightless eyes turned upward to the sound of the explosions above them, a heart-rending look of incomprehension on their faces.

Richard Dawkins|The Selfish Gene|They are in you and me; they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence. They have come a long way, those replicators. Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival machines.
Richard Dawkins|The Selfish Gene|But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.
Richard Dawkins|The Selfish Gene|The genes are master programmers, and they are programming for their lives. They are judged according to the success of their progress in coping with all the hazards which life throws at their survival machines, and the judge is the ruthless judge of the court of survival.
Tom DeMarco|Structured Analysis and System Specification|The human mind is an iterative processor. It never does anything precisely right the first time. What it does consummately well is to make a slight improvement to a flawed product.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|Goto Statement Considered Harmful|...our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer|Perhaps the most saddening thing now is that, even after all those years of frustrating experience, still so many people honestly believe that some law of nature tells us that machines have to be that way. They silence their doubts by observing how many of these machines have been sold, and derive from that observation the false sense of security that, after all, the design cannot have been that bad. But upon closer inspection, that line of defense has the same convincing strength as the argument that cigarette smoking must be healthy because so many people do it.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer|We should recognise the closed subroutine as one of the greatest software inventions; it has survived three generations of computers, and it will survive a few more, because it caters for the implementation of one of our basic patterns of abstraction.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|I envy such a man with all the forces of my embittered heart.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|And all because I was so confoundedly bored, gentlemen, all because I was so horribly bored. Crushed by doing nothing.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Question - who is he? Answer - a loafer. I must say it would have been a real pleasure to have heard that said about myself, for it would have meant that a positive definition had been found for me and that there was something one could say about me. "A loafer!" - why, it's a title, a purpose in life. It's a career, gentlemen, a career!
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Let us suppose, gentlemen, that man is not stupid... But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful. Phenomenally ungrateful. I'm even inclined to believe that the best definition of man is - a creature who walks on two legs and is ungrateful.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Is it not possible that man loves something besides prosperity? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? ...Whether it is good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant to smash things too.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|What is an insult but a sort of purification?
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|White Knights|For, after all, you do grow up, you do outgrow your ideals, which turn to dust and ashes, which are shattered into fragments; and if you have no other life, you just have to build one up out of these fragments. And all the time your soul is craving and longing for something else. And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking in these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|White Knights|Good Lord, only a em(moment) of bliss? Isn't such a moment sufficient for the whole of a man's life?

George Eliot|Middlemarch|Mr. Casaubon... concluded that the poets had much exaggerated the force of masculine passion.
George Eliot|Middlemarch|The remark was taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of a distinguished appearance.
George Eliot|Middlemarch|Plain women he regarded as he did the other severe facts of life, to be faced with philosophy and investigated by science.
George Eliot|Middlemarch|Only a few children in Middlemarch looked blonde by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure displayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations.
George Eliot|Middlemarch|The best piety is to enjoy - when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth's character as an agreeable planet.

Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|...il accompagnait une femme d'une cinquantaine d'années, laide, magnifiquement vêtue, et d'un rang social problématique.
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Les cœurs des femmes sont comme ces petits meubles à secret, pleins de tiroirs emboîtés les uns dans les autres; on se donne du mal, on se casse les ongles, et on trouve au fond quelque fleur desséchée, des brins de poussière ou le vide!
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Après avoir passé successivement par la demi-tasse, le grog, le bischof, le vin chaud et même l'eau rougie, il était revenu à la bière; et, de demi-heure en demi-heure, laissait tomber ce mot : «Bock!», ayant réduit son langage à l'indispensable.
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Des années passèrent; et il supportait le désoeuvrement de son intelligence et l'inertie de son coeur.
Gustave Flaubert|Lettre à Guy de Maupassant|Je ne sais pas si vous avez du talent. Ce que vous m'avez apporté prouve une certaine intelligence, mais n'oubliez point ceci, jeune homme, que le talent - suivant le mot de Buffon - n'est qu'une longue patience. Travaillez.
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|À la ville, avec le bruit des rues, le bourdonnement des théâtres et les clartés du bal, elles avaient des existences où le cœur se dilate, où les sens s'épanouissent. Mais elle, sa vie était froide comme un grenier dont la lucarne est au nord, et l'ennui, araignée silencieuse, filait sa toile dans l'ombre à tous les coins de son cœur.
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|Quel bonheur dans ce temps-là! quelle liberté! quel espoir! quelle abondance d'illusions!
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|Emma ressemblait à toutes les maîtresses; et le charme de la nouveauté, peu à peu tombant comme un vêtement, laissait voir à nu l'éternelle monotonie de la passion, qui a toujours les mêmes formes et le même langage.

Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|La rage de vouloir conclure est une des manies les plus funestes et les plus stériles qui appartiennent à l'humanité. Chaque religion et chaque philosophie a prétendu avoir Dieu à elle, toiser l'infini et connaître la recette du bonheur. Quel orgueil et quel néant! Je vois, au contraire, que les plus grands génies et les plus grandes œuvres n'ont jamais conclu. Homère, Shakespeare, Goethe, tous les fils aînés de Dieu (comme dit Michelet) se sont bien gardés de faire autre chose que représenter.
Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|Il n'y a pour moi dans le monde que les beaux vers, les phrases bien tournées, harmonieuses, chantantes, les beaux couchers de soleil, les clairs de lune, les tableaux colorés, les marbres antiques et les têtes accentuées. Au delà, rien.

Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|In the old days, craftsmen did not cut corners. They worked carefully, and they took care with every aspect of their work. Every part of the product was considered, and each was designed and made to be exactly as it should be. These craftsmen did not relax their thoughtful self-discipline even with respect to features of their work that would ordinarily not be visible. Although no one would notice if those features were not quite right, the craftsmen would be bothered by their consciences. So nothing was swept under the rug. Or, one might perhaps also say, there was no bullshit.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|Her statement is not germane to the enterprise of describing reality.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|It is just his lack of connection with a concern with truth - this indifference to how things really are - that I regard as the essence of bullshit.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|For the essence of bullshit is not that it is em(false) but that it is em(phony).
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|The problem of understanding why our attitude toward bullshit is generally more benign than our attitude toward lying is an important one, which I shall leave as an exercise for the reader.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|[The bullshitter] does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.

Gauss|Letter to Sophie Germain (1807)|The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a woman, who because of her sex and our prejudices encounters infinitely more obstacles than a man in familiarizing herself with complicated problems, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|His manners were less pure, but his character was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.

Alexander Grothendieck|Récoltes et semailles|It is in this gesture of "going beyond", to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one - it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity.

Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|The dog took no notice, for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath - in fact, he never barked even at the sheep except to order, when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Commination-service which, though offensive, had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|Seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her person, she edged off around the bush.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|...a young married man, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as "Susan Tall's husband".
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|Kiss my foot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman. No man who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or squirrel in his childhood, could possibly have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean bread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and compelled Jude to smother higher thinkings under immediate needs.
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species...
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|Here he stood, looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual sing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's groan.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|He himself was full of vague latter-day glooms and popular melancholies.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|There were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between "Mop" and the career of a second Paganini.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive organization.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|...his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|Too steady-going to be "a buck" (as fast and unmarried men were then called), he was an approximately fashionable man of mild type.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|He had been a lad of whom something was expected. Beyond this all had been chaos. That he would be successful in an original way, or that he would go to the dogs in an original way, seemed equally probable. The only absolute certainty about him was that he would not stand still in the circumstances amid which he was born.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|He had reached the stage in a young man's life when the grimness of the general human situation first becomes clear; and the realization of this causes ambition to halt awhile. In France it is not uncustomary to commit suicide at this stage; in England we do much better, or much worse, as  the case may be.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|There is a certain degree and tone of light which tends to disturb the equilibrium of the senses, and to promote dangerously the tenderer moods...
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|But I am getting used to the horror of my existence.
Thomas Hardy|The Trumpet-Major|He threw fictitiousness into his very gait, even now, when there was nobody to see him, and struck out at stems of wild parsley with his regimental switch as he had used to do when soldiering was new to him, and life in general a charming experience.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|For answer she ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|As in most villages so secluded as this, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the inhabitants...
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|...with a sudden start he worked on, climbing higher into the sky, and cutting himself off more and more from all intercourse with the sublunary world.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|Grace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved onward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her eyes wet.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|The young lady remained in his thoughts. He might have followed her; but he was not constitutionally active, and preferred a conjectural pursuit.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|Fitzpiers examined so closely that his breath touched her tenderly, at which their eyes rose to an encounter - hers showing themselves as deep and mysterious as interstellar space.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|"Well!", said Mrs. Penny, flopping into a chair, "my heart hasn't been in such a thumping state of uproar since I used to sit up on old Midsummer-eves to see who my husband was going to be."
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|"I fancy I've seen him look across at Miss Day in a warmer way than Christianity asked for..."
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|...it was an accepted thing that Leaf didn't in the least mind having no head, that deficiency of his being an unimpassioned matter of parish history.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|Thereupon he plunged in his hands, and they paddled together. It being the first time in his life that he touched female fingers under water, Dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|...they were never to be seen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinking - a local English custom of extraordinary antiquity, but stated by Fancy to be decidedly dying out among the better classes of society.
William Hazlitt|NULL|The studied forms of politeness do not give the greatest possible scope to an exuberance of wit and fancy. The fear of giving offence destroys sincerity, and without sincerity there can be no true enjoyment of society, nor unfettered exertion of intellectual activity.
Ernest Hemingway|The Sun Also Rises|I've not had this much fun since the war.
Christina Hoff-Somers|The War Against Boys|Does Gilligan really understand boys? She finds boys lacking in empathy, but does she empathize with them? ... The new pedagogies designed to "educate boys more like girls" (in Gloria Steinem's phrase) are not harmless. Their approach to boys is unacceptably meddlesome, and even subtly abusive.
Christina Hoff-Somers|The War Against Boys|An unacknowledged animus against boys is loose in our society.
Carl Honoré|In Praise of Slow|When God made time he made plenty of it.
Carl Honoré|In Praise of Slow|In Gulliver's Travels (1726), the Lilliputians decide that Gulliver consults his watch so often that it must be his god.

Aldous Huxley|Brave New World|He was a mine of irrelevant information.

Aldous Huxley|Brave New World|But industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.
Aldous Huxley|Brave New World|And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts.
Leopold Infeld|Quest|This law [objects all fall at the same speed], so simple that it is nearly obvious, is only three hundred years old!
Leopold Infeld|Quest|To ponder a problem for ten years without any encouragement from the outside world requires strength of character. This strength of character, perhaps more than his great intuition and imagination, lead to Einstein's scientific achievements.
Leopold Infeld|Quest|We are slaves to bathrooms, frigidaires, cars, radios, and millions of other things. Einstein tried to reduce them to the absolute minimum.
Leopold Infeld|Quest|But through all the stream of events, the impact of people and social life forced upon him, Einstein remains lonely, loving solitude, isolation, and conditions which secure undisturbed work.
Jane Jacobs|The Death and Life of Great American Cities|As in the pseudoscience of bloodletting, just so in the pseudoscience of city rebuilding and planning, years of learning and a plethora of subtle and complicated dogma have arisen on a foundation of nonsense.
Jane Jacobs|The Death and Life of Great American Cities|Cities are, by definition, full of strangers.
Jane Jacobs|The Death and Life of Great American Cities|Ask a houser how his planned neighborhood improves on the old city and he will cite, as a self-evident virtue, More Open Space... More Open Space for what? For muggings?
Jane Jacobs|The Death and Life of Great American Cities|In cities, liveliness and variety attract more liveliness, deadness and monotony repel life.

James Joyce|Two Gallants|That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, em(recherché) biscuit!
James Joyce|Two Gallants|Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him.
James Joyce|Two Gallants|His head was large, globular, and oily; it sweated in all weathers...
James Joyce|Two Gallants|Experience had embittered his heart against the world.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Isn't the sea what Algy calls it? a grey sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea.
James Joyce|Ulysses|You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.
James Joyce|Ulysses|He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully. For the rest let look on that will.
James Joyce|Ulysses|...papa's little lump of dung...
James Joyce|Ulysses|Mr. Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Thanky vous.
James Joyce|Ulysses|I speak the tongue of a race whose acme of mentality is the maxim: time is money. Material domination. Dominus! Lord! Where is the spirituality? Lord Jesus! Lord Salisbury. A sofa in a west end club. But the Greek!
James Joyce|Ulysses|He can kiss my royal Irish arse.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Hot mockturtle vapor and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr. Bloom's gullet.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Head like a prize pumpkin.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Mighty cheese.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Joy: I ate it: joy.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived? As for living, our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle has said.
James Joyce|Ulysses|I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is life ran very high in those days.
James Joyce|Ulysses|O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycouloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
James Joyce|Ulysses|Mr. Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash.
James Joyce|Ulysses|Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town clerk, Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.
James Joyce|Ulysses|He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow lemons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative mellonsmellonous osculation.

Thomas S. Kuhn|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|To be accepted as a paradigm, a thing must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|The temptation to write history backward is both omnipresent and perennial.
Milan Kundera|L'identité|Elle savourait l'absence totale d'aventures. Aventure: façon d'embrasser le monde. Elle ne voulait plus embrasser le monde. Elle ne voulait plus le monde.

R. D. Laing|The Politics of Experience|We all live in the hope that authentic meeting between human beings can still occur.
R. D. Laing|The Politics of Experience|Human beings seem to have an almost unlimited capacity for self-deception, for deceiving themselves into taking their own lies for the truth.
R. D. Laing|The Politics of Experience|We have to realize that we are as deeply afraid to live and to love as to die.
R. D. Laing|NULL|A man without a mask is indeed very rare.
Leibniz|NULL|Ordinary languages, though mostly helpful for the inferences of thought, are yet subject to countless ambiguities and cannot do the task of a calculus, which is to expose mistakes in inference... This remarkable advantage is afforded up to date only by the symbols of arithmeticians and algebraists, for whom inference consists only in the use of characters, and a mistake in thought and in the calculus is identical.
Longinus|On the Sublime|...it is not right to display the triviality of one's mind before an audience of all the ages.
Longinus|On the Sublime|... what wastes the talents of the present generation is the idleness in which all but a few of us pass our lives, only exerting ourselves or showing any enterprise for the sake of getting praise or pleasure out of it, never from the honourable and admirable motive of doing good to the world.
H. P. Lovecraft|The Picture in the House|In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding.
James Lovelock|Gaia - A New Look at Life on Earth|It is an intriguing thought that without the assistance of those anaerobic microflora living in the stinking muds of the sea-beds, lakes, and ponds, there might be no reading or writing of books. Without the methane they produce, oxygen would rise inexorably in concentration to a level at which any fire would be a holocaust and land life, apart from the microflora in damp places, would be impossible.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|...the Earth's disease, the fever brought on by a plague of people.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Most of all, [the greens] must drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Because we are tribal animals, the tribe does not act in unison until a real and present danger is perceived.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|I find it sad, but all too human, that there are vast bureaucracies concerned with nuclear waste, huge organizations devoted to decommissioning nuclear power stations, but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste, carbon dioxide.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Few, even among climate scientists and ecologists, seem yet to realize fully the potential severity, or the immanence, of catastrophic global disaster; understanding is still in the conscious mind alone and not yet the visceral reaction of fear.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|We are no more qualified to be the stewards or developers of the Earth than are goats to be gardeners.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Despite all these warnings, we carry on destroying and seem to worry only about the nearly trivial, even imaginary, risk of cancer from mobile telephones, power lines, pesticide residues in food, or sunlight; topping them all is a fear of anything to do with nuclear energy.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|How on Earth, you may ask, can something so good, something so benign as nuclear energy have been demonized to the point where people and sensitive governments are frightened to use it? I think it is a consequence of the vulnerability of people to the astonishing power to deceive of an endlessly repeated falsehood.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|What a capital article of furniture an arm-chair is, and what a treasure to a thoughtful man! During the long winter evenings it is often delightful, and always prudent, to lounge luxuriously in it, far from the turmoil of the madding crowd. A good fire, books, and pens; what safeguards these are against ennui! And how pleasant again, to forget books and pens in the delights of stirring the fire, while giving one's-self up to some sweet thought, or making a few rhymes for the amusement of friends! The hours glide by and fall into silence - into eternity, without making their sad passage felt.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|The moment was short and full of ecstasy; cold reason soon resumed her sway, and in the twinkling of an eye, a whole year was added to my life; my heart grew icy cold, and I found myself on a level with the throng of commonplace beings who crowd the earth.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|Happy is he who finds a friend whose heart and mind are in sympathy with his own; a friend who is linked to him by similar tastes, feelings, and knowledge; a friend who is not tormented by ambition or egotism; who prefers the shade of a tree to the pomp of a court! Happy is he who possesses a friend!
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|We were happy in our errors, but now - ah! all is sadly changed. We have been compelled, like others, to read the human heart; and truth, falling like a bomb into the midst of us, has forever destroyed the enchanted palace of illusion.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|From the expedition of the Argonauts to the Assembly of the Notables, from the nethermost Hell to the last fixed star of the Milky Way, to the confines of the Universe, to the gates of chaos, this is the vast expanse over the length and breadth of which I wander at leisure, for neither time nor space fail me.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|Delightful realm of Imagination, which the benevolent Being has bestowed upon man, to console him for the realities of life, I must quit thee.
Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|C'est un charme toujours nouveau pour moi que celui de contempler le ciel étoilé, et je n'ai pas à me reprocher d'avoir fait un seul voyage, ni même une simple promenade nocturne, sans payer le tribut d'admiration que je dois aux merveilles du firmament.
Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|Spectateur éphémère d'un spectacle éternel, l'homme lève un instant les yeux vers le ciel, et les referme pour toujours; mais, pendant cet instant rapide qui lui est accordé, de tous les points du ciel et depuis les bornes de l'univers, un rayon consolateur part de chaque monde et vient frapper ses regards, pour lui annoncer qu'il existe un rapport entre l'immensité et lui, et qu'il est associé à l'éternité.
Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|Combien peu de personnes, me disais-je, jouissent maintenant avec moi du spectacle sublime que le ciel étale inutilement pour les hommes assoupis!... Passe encore pour ceux qui dorment; mais qu'en coûterait-il à ceux qui se promènent, a ceux qui sortent en foule du théâtre de regarder un instant et d'admirer les brillantes constellations qui rayonnent de toutes parts sur leur tête? – Non, les spectateurs attentifs de Scapin ou de Jocrisse ne daigneront pas lever les yeux: Ils vont rentrer brutalement chez eux, ou ailleurs, sans songer que le ciel existe. Quelle bizarrerie!… parce qu'on peut le voir souvent et gratis, ils n'en veulent pas. Si le firmament était toujours voilé pour nous, si le spectacle qu'il nous offre dépendait d'un entrepreneur, les premières loges sur les toits seraient hors de prix, et les dames de Turin s'arracheraient ma lucarne.
Alberto Manguel|The Library at Night|At night I can read with a lightheartedness verging on insousiance.
Alberto Manguel|The Library at Night|My books have unlimited patience. They will wait for me till the end of my days.
Yann Martel|Beatrice and Virgil|The precept that location is the key to the success of a business applies to art, and even to life itself: we thrive or wither depending on how nourishing our environment is.
Guy de Maupassant|Au printemps|Oh! cet oeil de la femme, quelle puissance il a! Comme il trouble, envahit, possède, domine. Comme il semble profond, plein de promesses, d'infini! On appelle cela se regarder dans l'âme! Oh! monsieur, quelle blague! Si l'on y voyait, dans l'âme, on serait plus sage, allez.
Guy de Maupassant|Découverte|Moi je crois que ce qui nous séduit le plus dans les exotiques, c'est leur défaut de prononciation. Aussitôt qu'une femme parle mal notre langue, elle est charmante; si elle fait une faute de français par mot, elle est exquise, et si elle baragouine d'une façon tout à fait inintelligible, elle devient irrésistible.
Guy de Maupassant|Fort comme la mort|Ils sont incapables de s'attacher à une chose jusqu'à l'aimer uniquement, de s'intéresser à rien jusqu'à être illuminés par le bonheur de comprendre.
Guy de Maupassant|L'ermite|...ceux qui n'ont pas aimé poétiquement prennent et choisissent les femmes comme on choisit une côtelette à la boucherie, sans s'occuper d'autre chose que de la qualité de leur chair.
Guy de Maupassant|L'inutile beauté|Qu'y a-t-il, en effet, de plus ignoble, de plus répugnant que cet acte ordurier et ridicule de la reproduction des êtres, contre lequel toutes les âmes delicates sont et seront éternellement révoltées?
Guy de Maupassant|La Sicile|L'architecture est morte aujourd'hui, en ce siècle encore artiste, pourtant, mais qui semble avoir perdu le don de faire de la beauté avec des pierres, le mystérieux secret de la séduction par les lignes, le sens de la grâce dans les monuments. Nous paraissons ne plus comprendre, ne plus savoir que la seule proportion d'un mur peut donner à l'esprit la même sensation de joie artistique, la même émotion secrète et profonde qu'un chef-d'oeuvre de Rembrandt, de Velasquez ou de Véronèse.
Guy de Maupassant|La morte|Comme elle est petite cette ville à côté de l'autre, celle ou l'on vit! Et pourtant comme ils sont plus nombreux que les vivants, ces morts. Il nous faut de hautes maisons, des rues, tant de place, pour les quatre générations qui regardent le jour en même temps, boivent l'eau des sources, le vin des vignes et mangent le pain des plaines. Et pour toute les générations des morts, pour toute l'échelle de l'humanité descendue jusqu'à nous, presque rien, un champ, presque rien! La terre les reprend, l'oubli les efface. Adieu!
Guy de Maupassant|Les tombales|Et puis, j'aime aussi les cimetières, parce que ce sont des villes monstrueuses, prodigieusement habitées. Songez donc à ce qu'il y a de morts dans ce petit espace, à toutes les générations de Parisiens qui sont logés là, pour toujours, troglodytes définitifs enfermés dans leurs petits caveaux, dans leurs petits trous couverts d'une pierre ou marqués d'une croix, tandis que les vivants occupent tant de place et font tant de bruit, ces imbéciles.
Guy de Maupassant|Ma femme|J'avais trente-cinq ans, et je ne pensais pas plus à me marier qu'à me pendre.
Guy de Maupassant|Monsieur Parent|Les années se suivaient, lentes, monotones, et courtes parce qu'elles étaient vides.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|...elle consentit à épouser ce gros garçon très riche, qui n'était pas laid, mais qui ne lui plaisait guère, comme elle aurait consenti à passer un été dans un pays désagréable.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Ah!, vous ne comprenez pas, vous autres, comme c'est amusant, les affaires, non pas les affaires des marchands ou des commerçants, mais les grandes affaires, les nôtres! Oui, mon cher, quand on les entend bien, cela résume tout ce qu'ont aimé les hommes, c'est en même temps la politique, la guerre, la diplomatie, tout, tout! Il faut toujours chercher, trouver, inventer, tout comprendre, tout prévoir, tout combiner, tout oser. Le grand combat, aujourd'hui, c'est avec l'argent qu'on le livre.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|C'est bon, dit-il, d'être jeune, quelquefois.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Laissez donc, dit-il, je la connais, leur intelligence, à tous ces brasseurs d'affaires. Ils n'ont qu'une chose en tête : l'argent! Toutes les pensées que nous donnons aux belles choses, tous les actes que nous perdons pour nos caprices, toutes les heures que nous jetons à nos distractions, toute la force que nous gaspillons pour nos plaisirs, toute l'ardeur et toute la puissance que nous prend l'amour, l'amour divin, ils les emploient à chercher de l'or, à songer à l'or, à amasser de l'or! L'homme, l'homme intelligent, vit pour toutes les grandes tendresses désintéressées, les arts, l'amour, la science, les voyages, les livres; et s'il cherche l'argent, c'est parce que cela facilite les joies réelles de l'esprit et même le bonheur du cœur! Mais eux, ils n'ont rien dans l'esprit et dans le coeur que ce goût ignoble du trafic! Ils ressemblent aux hommes de valeur, ces écumeurs de la vie, comme le marchand de tableaux ressemble au peintre, comme l'éditeur ressemble à l'écrivain, comme le directeur de théâtre ressemble au poète.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Elle ne les vit pas, ou ne les reconnut point. Toute pâle sur son oreiller blanc, avec ses cheveux blonds répandus sur ses épaules, elle regardait, de ses clairs yeux bleus, le monde inconnu, mystérieux et fantastique où vivent les fous.
Guy de Maupassant|Notre Coeur|Mais les mots noirs sur le papier blanc, c'est l'âme toute nue.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|Les mots ont une âme.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|La profonde et délicieuse jouissance qui vous monte au coeur devant certaines pages, devant certaines phrases, ne vient pas seulement de ce qu'elles disent; elle vient d'une accordance absolue de l'expression avec l'idée, d'une sensation d'harmonie, de beauté secrète, échappant la plupart du temps au jugement des foules.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|Il [Flaubert] avait pour les grands écrivains français une admiration frénétique; il possédait par coeur des chapitres entiers des maîtres, et il les déclamait d'une voix tonnante, grisé par la prose, faisant sonner les mots, scandant, modulant, chantant la phrase.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|La misanthropie de ses oeuvres [Flaubert] ne vient pas d'autres chose. La saveur amère qui s'en degage n'est que cette constante constatation de la médiocrité, de la banalité, de la sottise sous toutes les formes.
Guy de Maupassant|Qui sait?|Je ne refuse pas de voir le monde, de causer, de dîner avec des amis, mais lorsque je les sens depuis longtemps près de moi, même les plus familiers, ils me lassent, me fatiguent, m'énervent, et j'éprouve une envie grandissante, harcelante, de les voir partir ou de m'en aller, d'être seul.
Guy de Maupassant|Solitude|Quoi que nous tentions, quoi que nous fassions, quels que soient l'élan de nos coeurs, l'appel de nos lèvres et l'étreinte de nos bras, nous sommes toujours seuls.
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|Mais d'autres hommes, parcourant d'un éclair de pensée le cercle étroit des satisfactions possibles, demeurent atterrés devant le néant du bonheur, la monotonie et la pauvreté des joies terrestres.
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|O liberté! liberté! seul bonheur, seul espoir et seul rêve!
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|Certes, en certains jours, j'éprouve l'horreur de ce qui est jusqu'à désirer la mort. Je sens jusqu'à la souffrance suraiguë la monotonie invariable des paysages, des figures et des pensées. Le médiocrité de l'univers m'étonne et me révolte, la petitesse de toutes choses m'emplit de dégoût, la pauvreté des êtres humains m'anéantit.
Guy de Maupassant|Une vie|Quelques pigeons se promenaient au bord du ruisseau, cherchant leur vie.
Guy de Maupassant|Â Vendre|Partir à pied, quand le soleil se lève, et marcher dans la rosée, le long des champs, au bord de la mer calme, quelle ivresse!
André Maurois|Climats|Les hommes livrent leur âme, comme les femme leur corps, par zones successives et bien défendues.
Ian McEwan|The Child in Time|Shakespeare would have grasped wave functions, Donne would have understood complementarity and relative time. They would have been excited. What richness! They would have plundered this new science for their imagery. And they would have educated their audiences too. But you 'arts' people, you're not only ignorant of these magnificent things, you're rather proud of knowing nothing.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|One person who has mastered life is better than a thousand persons who have mastered only the contents of books.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|The just are they that take everything alike from God no matter what it is, big and little, good and bad, all the same, no more no less, but one thing like another.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|Turning and change lead nowhere; stopping, we progress.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|The soul is motionless when nothing whatever can perturb her, when she is neither glad nor sad and cannot be gladdened nor yet saddened, and when she has no need to cling to any creature.

Meister Eckhart|NULL|I must let virtue go if I would see God face to face.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head.

John Morressy|A Tale of Three Wizards|The Harkeners were peaceful folk who devoted their lives to listening for instructive and consolatory voices from another plane.

Belsheer thought that over, and his expression brightened. "It would be nice to spend a few weeks sitting in the sun, listening to a loaf of bread."

Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|The issue is not indifference to established knowledge; it's the emergence of a positive em(hostility) to such knowledge.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|Americans no longer distinguish the phrase "you're wrong" from "you're stupid". To disagree is to disrespect. To correct another is to insult.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|College students may not be dumber than they were thirty years ago, but their sense of entitlement and their unfounded self-confidence have grown considerably.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|"Well," the student said, "your guess is as good as mine." [Robert] Jastrow stopped the young man short. "No, no, no" he said emphatically. "em(My) guesses are much, em(much) better than yours."
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|When feelings matter more than rationality or facts, education is a doomed enterprise. Emotion is an unassailable defense against expertise, a moat of anger and resentment in which reason and knowledge quickly drown. And when students learn that emotion trumps everything else, it is a lesson they will take with them for the rest of their lives.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|To faculty everywhere, the lesson was obvious: the campus of a top university is not a place for intellectual exploration. It is a luxury home, rented for four to six years, nine months at a time, by children of the elite who may shout at faculty as if they're berating clumsy maids in a colonial mansion.

Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|In Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|Think of Richard Nixon, or Jimmy Carter, or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein's case, a photograph of a face). Of words, nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter, but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue entirely.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|It is not merely that, on the television screen, entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesized its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcotized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil's observation that "television is the soma of Aldous Huxley's em(Brave New World)". Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice; we watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens, or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk... then culture-death is a clear possibility.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|Public consciousness has not yet assimilated the point that technology is ideology...
Neil Postman|Technopoly|Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, and takes its orders from technology.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|It's a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|I will go further: in Technopoly, all experts are invested with the charisma of priestliness.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|I am constantly amazed at how obediently people accept explanations that begin with the words "the computer shows..." or "the computer has determined..." It is Technopoly's equivalent of the sentence "It is God's will.", and the effect is roughly the same.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|The Technopoly story is without a moral centre. It puts in its place efficiency, interest, and economic advance.

Marcel Proust|Albertine disparue|Car il y a dans ce monde où tout s'use, où tout périt, une chose qui tombe en ruines, qui se détruit encore plus complètement, en laissant encore moins de vestiges que la Beauté: c'est le Chagrin.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Quand d'un passé ancien rien ne subsiste, après la mort des êtres, après la destruction des choses seules, plus frêles mais plus vivaces, plus immatérielles, plus persistantes, plus fidèles, l'odeur et la saveur restent encore longtemps, comme des âmes, à se rappeler, à attendre, à espérer, sur la ruine de tout le reste, à porter sans fléchir, sur leur gouttelette presque impalpable, l'édifice immense du souvenir.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Quand, plus tard, j'ai eu l'occasion de rencontrer, au cours de ma vie, dans des couvents par exemple, des incarnations vraiment saintes de la charité active, elles avaient généralement un air allègre, positif, indifférent et brusque de chirurgien pressé, ce visage où ne se lit aucune commisération, aucun attendrissement devant la souffrance humaine, aucune crainte de la heurter, et qui est le visage sans douceur, le visage antipathique et sublime de la vraie bonté.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Je vis si résolument en dehors des contingences physiques que mes sens ne prennent pas la peine de me les notifier.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Un petit coup au carreau, comme si quelque chose l'avait heurté, suivi d'une ample chute légère comme de grains de sable qu'on eût laissé tomber d'une fenêtre au-dessus, puis la chute s'étendant, se réglant, adoptant un rythme, devenant fluide, sonore, musicale, innombrable, universelle: c'était la pluie.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Il se taisait, il regardait mourir leur amour.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Chose étrange que ces mots «deux ou trois fois», rien que des mots, des mots prononcés dans l'air, à distance, puissent ainsi déchirer le cœur comme s'ils le touchaient véritablement, puissent rendre malade, comme un poison qu'on absorberait.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Car l'un ne voulait pas d'un sucre d'orge rouge parce qu'il préférait le violet et l'autre, les larmes aux yeux, refusait une prune que voulait lui acheter sa bonne, parce que, finit-il par dire d'une voix passionnée: «J'aime mieux, l'autre prune, parce qu'elle a un ver!»

Marcel Proust|La prisonnière|Tantôt, par des jours irrémédiablement mauvais, disait-on, rien que la résidence dans la maison, située au milieu d'une pluie égale et continue, avait la glissante douceur, le silence calmant, l'intérêt d'une navigation; une autre fois, par un jour clair, en restant immobile dans mon lit, c'était laisser tourner les ombres autour de moi comme d'un tronc d'arbre.
Marcel Proust|La prisonnière|...pour aviser au plus vite, j'essayai de téléphoner à Andrée; je me saisis du récepteur, j'invoquai les divinités implacables, mais ne fis qu'exciter leur fureur qui se traduisit par ces mots: «Pas libre.»

Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|La vérité est que je n'appartiens guère à cette Terre où je me sens si exilé; il faut toute la force de la loi de gravitation pour m'y maintenir et que je ne m'évade pas dans une autre sphère.
Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|Ce n'était pas «Rachel quand du Seigneur» qui me semblait peu de chose, c'était la puissance de l'imagination humaine, l'illusion sur laquelle reposaient les douleurs de l'amour, que je trouvais grandes.
Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|L'amour? Je le fais souvent mais je n'en parle jamais.
Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|...après avoir poussé un léger soupir, elle se contenta de manifester de la nullité de l'impression que lui produisaient la vue de l'historien et la mienne en exécutant certains mouvements des ailes du nez avec une précision qui attestait l'inertie absolue de son attention désoeuvrée.
Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|Au pied du lit, convulsée par tous les souffles de cette agonie, ne pleurant pas mais par moments trempée de larmes, ma mère avait la désolation sans pensée d'un feuillage que cingle la pluie et retourne le vent.

Marcel Proust|Le côté de Guermantes|Les Courvoisier se faisaient de l'intelligence une idée moins favorable et, pour peu qu'on ne fût pas de leur monde, être intelligent n'était pas loin de signifier «avoir probablement assassiné père et mère».

Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|...la mort de millions d'inconnus nous chatouille à peine et presque moins désagréablement qu'un courant d'air. Mme Verdurin, souffrant pour ses migraines de ne plus avoir de croissant à tremper dans son café au lait, avait obtenu de Cottard une ordonnance qui lui permettait de s'en faire faire dans certain restaurant dont nous avons parlé. Cela avait été presque aussi difficile à obtenir des pouvoirs publics que la nomination d'un général. Elle reprit son premier croissant le matin où les journaux narraient le naufrage du Lusitania. Tout en trempant le croissant dans le café au lait et donnant des pichenettes à son journal pour qu'il pût se tenir grand ouvert sans qu'elle eût besoin de détourner son autre main des trempettes, elle disait : «Quelle horreur! Cela dépasse en horreur les plus affreuses tragédies.» Mais la mort de tous ces noyés ne devait lui apparaître que réduite au milliardième, car tout en faisant, la bouche pleine, ces réflexions désolées, l'air qui surnageait sur sa figure, amené probablement là par la saveur du croissant, si précieux contre la migraine, était plutôt celui d'une douce satisfaction.
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Il y avait certes, maintenant comme alors, la splendeur antique inchangée d'une lune cruellement, mystérieusement sereine, qui versait aux monuments encore intacts l'inutile beauté de sa lumière...
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Mais comme chaque fois que je me trouvais arraché à mes habitudes, sorti à une autre heure, dans un lieu nouveau, j'éprouvais un vif plaisir.

Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|...le sens artistique, c'est-à-dire la soumission à la réalité intériere...
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Le devoir et la tache d'un écrivain sont ceux d'un traducteur.
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Ça me faisait toujours penser au vers de Victor Hugo: «Emporte le bonheur et laisse-moi l'ennui.»
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Car je comprenais que mourir n'était pas quelque chose de nouveau, mais qu'au contraire depuis mon enfance j'étais déjà mort bien des fois.
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Là où je cherchais les grandes lois, on m'appelait fouilleur de détails.
Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Depuis le jour de l'escalier, rien du monde, aucun bonheur, qu'il vînt de l'amitié des gens, des progrès de mon œuvre, de l'espérance de la gloire, ne parvenait plus à moi que comme un si pâle soleil qu'il n'avait plus la vertu de me réchauffer, de me faire vivre, de me donner un désir quelconque, et encore était-il trop brillant, si blême qu'il fût, pour mes yeux qui préféraient se fermer, et je me retournais du côté du mur.
Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Blottie toute seule derrière elle, une pauvre petite étoile allait servir d'unique compagne à la lune solitaire, tandis que celle-ci, tout en protégeant son amie, mais plus hardie et allant de l'avant, brandirait comme une arme irrésistible, comme un symbole oriental, son ample et merveilleux croissant d'or.
Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Il est mort! Mais non, on exagère, on exagère!
Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Vous êtes plutôt bizarroïde dans vos renseignements, mon cher!

Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Il voyait le peu qu'on pouvait attendre des affections humaines, il s'y était résigné.
Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Cependant l'aviateur sembla hésiter sur sa voie; je sentais ouvertes devant lui — devant moi, si l'habitude ne m'avait pas fait prisonnier — toutes les routes de l'espace, de la vie...
Marcel Proust|Sodome et Gomorrhe|Sans doute parlait-il ainsi par mécontentement de ne pas être invité, et aussi à cause de la satisfaction qu'ont les hommes «occupés» — fût-ce par le travail le plus sot — de «ne pas avoir le temps» de faire ce que vous faites.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|The fault I find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three of four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|...as will exert a benign influence on the mind by giving it a hankering for impossible journeys through the realms of time.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognized that large handwriting in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon ill-formed characters, suggestive, perhaps, to less biased eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, or a want of sincerity and will-power.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened at that moment to extinguish every particle of light in his brain.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress of which he had been so imprudent as to point out to her the delights, every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his torture chamber.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Let's hope she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a whole fortnight with a woman who takes about as much interest in music as a tone-deaf newt - that would be fun!
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Verdurin! What a name! Oh, it must be said that they're perfect specimens of their disgusting kind! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|But the harshness of his steely gaze was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Swann speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests.

Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Quoi, vous croyez qu'elle a un derrière blue ciel comme les singes?
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Et je me lassai d'attendre, bien que quelques habituées fort humbles, soi-disant ouvrières, mais toujours sans travail, fussent venues me faire de la tisane et tenir avec moi une longue conversation à laquelle — malgré le sérieux des sujets traités — la nudité partielle ou complète de mes interlocutrices donnait une savoureuse simplicité.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|La constante vision de ce bonheur imaginaire m'aidait à supporter la destruction du bonheur réel.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Quand on aime, l'amour est trop grand pour pouvoir être contenu tout entier en nous; il irradie vers la personne aimée, rencontre en elle une surface qui l'arrête, le force à revenir vers son point de départ; et c'est ce choc en retour de notre propre tendresse que nous appelons les sentiments de l'autre et qui nous charme plus qu'à l'aller, parce que nous ne connaissons pas qu'elle vient de nous.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|...la permanence et la durée ne sont promises à rien, pas même à la douleur.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|J'appliquais à son visage rendu indécis par le crépuscule le masque de mes rêves les plus passionnés, mais lisais dans son regard tourné vers moi l'horreur de mon néant.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Mais il ne me répondit pas, soit étonnement de mes paroles, attention à son travail, souci de l'étiquette, dureté de son ouïe, respect du lieu, crainte du danger, paresse d'intelligence ou consigne du directeur.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Et dès ce premier matin le soleil me désignait au loin, d'un doigt souriant, ces cimes bleues de la mer qui n'ont de nom sur aucune carte géographique, jusqu'à ce qu'étourdi de sa sublime promenade à la surface retentissante et chaotique de leurs crêtes et de leurs avalanches, il vînt se mettre à l'abri du vent dans ma chambre, se prélassant sur le lit défait et égrenant ses richesses sur le lavabo mouillé, dans la malle ouverte, où par sa splendeur même et son luxe déplacé, il ajoutait encore à l'impression du désordre.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Mais avant tout j'avais ouvert mes rideaux dans l'impatience de savoir qu'elle était la Mer qui jouait ce matin-là au bord du rivage, comme une Néréïde. Car chacune de ces Mers ne restait jamais plus qu'un jour. Le lendemain il y en avait une autre qui parfois lui ressemblait. Mais je ne vis jamais deux fois la même.
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Comment s'appelle-t-il, cet ostrogoth-là, me demandait Albertine...
Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Elle était de ces femmes à qui c'est un si grand plaisir de serrer la main qu'on est reconnaissant à la civilisation d'avoir fait du shake-hand un acte permis entre jeunes gens et jeunes filles qui s'abordent.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|It has always, therefore, been my custom not to tie myself down to universal or general rules... For rules are rarely of such a kind that their validity cannot be shaken and overthrown in some particular or other.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|If therefore we have received no fairer gift from heaven than speech, what shall we regard as so worthy of laborious cultivation, or in what should we sooner desire to excel our fellow-men, than that in which humanity excels all other living things?
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|Style has three kinds of excellence: correctness, lucidity, and elegance.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|But such practices have disappeared into the limbo of absurdities.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|Again it frequently happens that the more learned the teacher, the more lucid and intelligible is his instruction. For clearness is the first virtue of eloquence... Consequently the worse a teacher is, the harder he will be to understand.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|...the preliminary task of unteaching is harder than that of teaching.
Hubert Reeves|Patience dans l'azur|Étendez-vous sur le sol, la nuit, loin des lumières. Fermez les yeux. Après quelques minutes, ouvrez-les sur la voûte étoilée... Vous aurez le vertige. Collé a la surface de votre vaisseau spatial, vous vous sentirez em(dans) l'espace. Goutez-en longuement l'ivresse.

Mme Roland|Mémoires|Sous le tranquil abri du toit paternel, j'étais heureuse dès l'enfance avec des fleurs et des livres: dans l'étroite enceinte d'une prison, au milieu des fers imposés par la tyrannie la plus révoltante, j'oublie l'injustice des hommes, leurs sottises et mes maux, avec des livres et des fleurs.
Mme Roland|Mémoires|Enfin, je ne me suis mariée qu'à vingt-cinq ans, et avec une ame telle qu'on peut la présumer, des sens très-inflammables, beaucoup d'instruction sur divers objets; j'avais si bien évité l'instruction sur certain autre, que les événemens du mariage me parurent aussi surprenans que désagréables.
Mme Roland|Mémoires|A quatorze ans, comme aujourd'hui, j'avais environs cinq pieds; ma taille avait acquis toute sa croissance; la jambe bien faite, le pied bien posé, les hanches très-relevées; la poitrine large et superbement meublée...
Philip Roth|Portnoy's Complaint|And then, of course, my father is a man who has a certain amount of worrying to do each day, and sometimes he just has to forgo listening to the conversations going on around him in order to fulfill his anxiety requirement.

Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|Today, public life has also become a matter of formal obligation. Most citizens approach their dealings with the state in a spirit of resigned acquiescence, but this public enervation is in its scope much broader than political affairs. Manners and ritual interchanges with strangers are looked on as at best formal and dry, at worst as phony. The stranger himself is a threatening figure, and few people can take great pleasure in that world of strangers, the cosmopolitan city.
Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|Behaving with strangers in an emotionally satisfying way and yet remaining aloof from them was seen by the mid-18th century as the means by which the human animal was transformed into a social being.
Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|During the 19th century the family came to appear less and less the center of a particular, non-public region, more an idealized refuge, a world all its own, with a higher moral value than the public realm.
William Shakespeare|Hamlet|O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
William Shakespeare|Hamlet|Come; the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.
William Shakespeare|Hamlet|What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in action, how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!

Steven Shapin|The Scientific Revolution|The framework that modern natural philosophers preferred to Aristotelian teleology was one that explicitly modelled nature on the characteristics of a em(machine).
Steven Shapin|The Scientific Revolution|The machine metaphor might, then, be a vehicle for "taking the wonder out" of our understanding of nature or, as the sociologist Max Weber put it in the early twentieth century, for the "disenchantment of the world".
George Bernard Shaw|Caesar and Cleopatra|Their chief is called Julius Caesar. His father was a tiger and his mother was a burning mountain.
George Bernard Shaw|London Music|All artsmen know what it is to be enthusiastically praised for something so easy that they are half ashamed of it, and to receive not a word of encouragement for their finest strokes.
George Bernard Shaw|Man and Superman|Hell, in short, is a place where you have nothing to do but amuse yourself.
George Bernard Shaw|Misalliance|The secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not. The cure for it is occupation, because occupation means preoccupation; and the preoccupied person is neither happy nor unhappy, but simply alive and active, which is pleasanter than any happiness, until you are tired of it.
George Bernard Shaw|Misalliance|A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of hell.
George Bernard Shaw|The Apple Cart|I had rather be a dog than the Prime Minister of a country where the only thing the inhabitants can be serious about are football and refreshments.
George Bernard Shaw|The Doctor's Dilemma|No man who is occupied in doing a very difficult thing, and doing it very well, ever loses his self-respect.

George Bernard Shaw|The Theatre of the Future|The manager of the C.F.A. Theatre regrets to have to announce that his attempt to procure a new play introducing a married woman in love with her own husband, and without a past, has been wholly unsuccessful. An appeal to our leading dramatic authors to write such a play has elicited a unanimous refusal to compromise their professional reputation by dealing with an abnormal situation and catering for morbid tastes.
George Bernard Shaw|Three Plays by Brieux|I wanted to get at the facts. I was prepared for the facts being unflattering: had I not already faced the fact that instead of being a fallen angel I was first cousin to a monkey?
George Bernard Shaw|NULL|I should prefer to die in a reasonably dry ditch under the stars.
R. B. Sheridan|NULL|I hope, my Lord, those buckles have had the unspeakable satisfaction of being honoured with your Lordship's approbation?

Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|The most cherished goal in physics, as in bad romance novels, is unification.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|To be fair, we have made two experimental discoveries in the past few decades: that neutrinos have mass and that the universe is dominated by a mysterious dark energy that seems to be accelerating its expansion.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|On the other hand, if string theorists are wrong, they can't be just a little wrong. If the new dimensions and symmetries do not exist, then we will count string theorists among science's greatest failures, like those who continued to work on Ptolemaic epicycles while Kepler and Galileo forged ahead. Theirs will be a cautionary tale of how not to do science, how not to let theoretical conjecture get so far beyond the limits of what can rationally be argued that one starts engaging in fantasy.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|Some people need to think through everything very carefully, and this takes time, as they get easily confused. It's not hard to feel superior to such people, until you remember that Einstein was one of them.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|What is remarkable to me is the number of distinguished scientists who seem unable to accept the possibility either that string theory or the hypothesis of a random multiverse is wrong.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|...it is not good for any field if any one person's views are taken too authoritatively. There is no scientist, not even Newton or Einstein, who was not wrong on a substantial number of issues they had strong views about.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|If your ideas are right and you fight for them, you'll accomplish something... No one but you can develop your ideas, and no one but you will fight for them.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|But what is equally important, and sobering, is how often we fool ourselves. And we fool ourselves not only individually but en masse. The tendency of a group of human beings to quickly come to believe something that its individual members will later see as obviously false is truly amazing.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|Feyerabend insisted that scientists should never agree, unless they are forced to.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|If a highly disciplined subject like physics is vulnerable to the symptoms of groupthink, what may be happening in other, less rigorous areas?
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|[String theorists] seem to feel that appeal to consensus within their community is equivalent to rational argument.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|Good ideas are not taken seriously enough when they come from people of low status in the academic world; conversely, the ideas of high-status people are often taken too seriously.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|I have got into a family of originals, whom I may one day attempt to describe for your amusement.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|...and as to the few letters that passed between us, they are all in my uncle's hands, and I hope they contain nothing contrary to innocence and honour.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|I vow to God your impertinence is exceedingly provoking.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|...began to practise upon the French horn; and, being in the very first rudiments of execution, produced such discordant sounds, as might have discomposed the organs of an ass.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|...and let me tell you, it is no small alleviation of my grievances, that I have a sensible friend, to whom I can communicate my crusty humours, which, by retention, would grow intolerably acrimonious.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|...and I am persuaded it produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm.
Tobias Smollett|The Expedition of Humphry Clinker|Some cried, some swore, and the tropes and figures of Billingsgate were used without reserve in all their native zest and flavour; nor were those flowers of rhetoric unattended with significant gesticulations.

Emile Souvestre|An Attic Philosopher In Paris|Getting the coffee ready is the most delicate and attractive of domestic operations to one who lives alone; it is the masterpiece of a bachelor's housekeeping.
Emile Souvestre|An Attic Philosopher In Paris|Is it really certain that happiness is the prize of brilliant successes, rather than of a wisely accepted poverty? Ah, if men but knew in what a small dwelling joy can live, and how little it costs to furnish it!
W. B. Stanford|The Sound of Greek|He calls it [some uses of the Greek letter sigma] "a graceless disagreeable letter which gives great pain when used in excess, for its hissing seems more akin to that of a brute beast than to that of a rational being."

Laurence Sterne|A Sentimental Journey|Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I was to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise? and what mighty mischief could ensue?
Laurence Sterne|A Sentimental Journey|...there thou mayest solace thy soul in converse sweet...
Laurence Sterne|A Sentimental Journey|Hail ye sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road of it!
Laurence Sterne|A Sentimental Journey|Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance, in quest of melancholy adventures.
Laurence Sterne|A Sentimental Journey|The old officer was reading attentively a small pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of spectacles. As soon as I sat down, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case, return'd them and the book into his pocket altogether. I half rose up, and made him a bow. Translate this into any civilized language in the world, the sense is this: "Here's a poor stranger come in to the box; he seems as if he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose - 'tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely, in his face - and using him worse than a German."

Nassim Taleb|NULL|For Yevgenia Krasnova, a person could love one book, at most a few - beyond this was a form of promiscuity.
Nassim Taleb|NULL|Our problem is not just that we do not know the future, we do not know much of the past either.
Nassim Taleb|NULL|The idea that in order to make a decision you need to focus on the consequences (which you can know) rather than the probability (which you can't know) is the central idea of uncertainty. Much of my life is based on it.
Nassim Taleb|NULL|One frequent confusion: people believe that I am suggesting that agents should bet on Black Swans taking place, when I am saying they should avoid blowing up should a Black Swan take place.
Nassim Taleb|NULL|People do not realize that success consists mainly in avoiding losses, not in trying to derive profits.
Nassim Taleb|NULL|Do not confuse the absence of volatility with the absence of risk.
James Tate|NULL|Even the abandoned husk of a person can sometimes perform useful tasks and enjoy mildly good times...
Paul Theroux|The Tao of Travel|The whole point of travelling is to arrive alone, like a spectre, in a strange country at nightfall, not in the brightly lit capital but by the back door, in the wooded countryside, hundreds of miles from the metropolis... Arriving in the hinterland with only the vaguest plans is a liberating event. It can be a solemn occasion for discovery, or more like an irresponsible and random haunting of another planet.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain storms, and did my duty faithfully.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|But lo! men have become the tools of their tools.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|Even in our New England towns the accidental possession of wealth, and its manifestations in dress and equipage alone, obtain for the possessor almost universal respect.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|A lady once offered me a mat, but as I had no room to spare within the house, nor time to spare within or without to shake it, I declined it, preferring to wipe my feet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the beginnings of evil.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|Time is but the stream I go a-fishin in.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion so companionable as solitude.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|Give me the poverty that enjoys true wealth.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a poet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his comings and goings?
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
H. D. Thoreau|Walden|Our lives are frittered away in detail... Simplify, simplify.
H. D. Thoreau|NULL|No man is rich enough to keep a poet in his pay.
Paul Tillich|NULL|By its nature, the metropolis provides what otherwise could be given only by traveling; namely, the strange.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|And so the liberal tendency became a habit with Stepan Arkadyich, and he liked his newspaper, as he liked his cigar after dinner, for the slight haze it produced in his head.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|The conversation never flagged for a minute, so that the old princess, who, in case a topic was lacking, always kept two heavy cannon in reserve - classical versus modern education, and general military conscription - did not have to move them up...
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|...but Vronsky went on looking at him as at a lamppost, and the young man grimaced, feeling that he was losing his self-possession under the pressure of this non-recognition of himself as a human being.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|It showed him the eternal error people make in imagining that happiness is the realization of desires.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|There are no conditions to which a person cannot grow accustomed, especially if he sees that everyone around him lives in the same way.
Leo Tolstoy|Hadji Murad|All this was as it should be, because the welfare and happiness of the whole world depended on him, and wearied though he was, he would still not refuse the universe his assistance.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|...the nakedness of woman already tormented me. The hours I spent alone were not pure ones.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|It's really quite remarkable how complete the illusion is that beauty is the same as goodness.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|A honeymoon is an embarrassing, shameful, loathsome, pathetic business, and most of all it is tedious, unbearably tedious! It is something similar to what I experienced when I was learning how to smoke. I felt like vomiting, my saliva flowed, but I swallowed it and pretended I was enjoying myself.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|In town a man can live for a hundred years and never notice that he's long dead and buried. There's never any time to study your conscience; you're busy all the time.
Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|Unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity.
Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.

Chögyam Trungpa|Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism|Let people look at you and examine you. You are at their disposal.
Chögyam Trungpa|NULL|The attainment of enlightenment from ego's point of view is extreme death, the death of self, the death of me and mine, the death of the watcher. It is the ultimate and final disappointment. Treading the spiritual path is painful. It is a constant unmasking, peeling off layer after layer of masks. It involves insult after insult.
Chögyam Trungpa|NULL|Chaos should be regarded as extremely good news.
