Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|In the 20th century we have passed through a unique period, one in which architecture as a discipline has been in a state that is almost unimaginably bad. Sometimes I think of it as a mass psychosis of unprecedented dimension, in which the people of earth - in large numbers and in almost all contemporary societies - have created a form of architecture which is against life, insane, image-ridden, hollow.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|For twenty years, I spent two or three hours a day looking at pairs of things... comparing them, and asking myself: em(Which has more life?)
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|What I am proposing is that these observations of an observer's inner state are not merely a reflection of a person's attitude or psychology, but can actually be used to measure something real about the external world em(itself).
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 1|Can it really be true that something as elusive as freedom - and perhaps even the deeper capacity to be human - depends in some way on the environment?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Living structure in buildings can only be em(generated). It cannot be created by brute force from designs... the building - its conception, plan design, detailed layout, structural design, and material detail are all unfolded, step by step in time.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Insofar as unfolded buildings are lovable, what we love about them is not their age but the rightness which we experience in them. This rightness got into them em(as a result of a step-by-step unfolding process). We can see and feel the rightness. And we see it and feel it because it has a different geometric character from the character which is created by "design".
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The step-by-step approach works. The all-or-nothing does not work. This is the secret of biological evolution... It would be impossible for nature to "design" a system as complex as an organism all at once.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|As any designer will tell you, it is the first steps in a design process which count for most. The first few strokes, which create the form, carry within them the destiny of the rest.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|It is essential to form this vision of the emerging building em(in your mind's eye), not in sketches on paper. Words and interior visions, when seen with your eyes closed, are more labile, more fluid, transformable, and three-dimensional, than sketches or physical designs.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|...to prune a design, and look at it over and over again, searching for any little parts that are not centers - and then work at it, compressing, cutting, simplifying, re-arranging, until every single part, and every part of every part, and every part between the parts are all centers. This is tremendously hard work.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The single most important thing that happens during the process of making anything, is the ever watchful task of getting the next bit of sequence right and modifying it as we go along. Paying attention to what has to be done next, and getting this right, is as important as what one actually does. The more one understands the idea of unfolding, and the more one understands the key role which sequence plays in the unfolding process, the more it becomes clear that the process of design and the process of construction are inseparable.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|We aim, by the end, to remove all extraneous structure. What we want is to cut and cut and cut until there is almost nothing left.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Simplicity is the state in which all structure is removed, except exactly that structure which is required.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|You know the em(feeling) which the thing will have. But you do em(not) know the em(form). In fact, you keep having to change the form, because as the work unfolds, you find out many, many details which have the wrong feeling, which do not function, in response to the whole, as you thought they would. Because you keep the em(feeling) constant, you em(have) to change the form.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|It is em(feeling), above all, which has the greatest chance of dealing with the whole in a balanced way, because it is precisely the nature of feeling that it does embrace the whole - while intellectual ideas more often concentrate on parts and end up getting them out of proportion.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|Most present-day architects like em(talking) about construction, but are afraid of construction tools, and have little feeling for them. In many cases, getting their hands dirty scares them.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 2|The gradual rubbing together of phenomena to get the right result, the slow process of getting things right, is almost unknown to us today.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|In our century the loss of control and loss of belonging started with the car.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|...making even tiny changes too casually can be damaging.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|What an extreme comment on the state of the world: that people should weep, merely because they are allowed to sketch on paper the apartment layout that they wanted for their family.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|Go into your mind's eye pretending to walk through the building, as if it existed already, but you are seeing it for the first time, and are stunned by its beauty. Your are genuinely surprised. You find yourself stunned by the beauty of the rooms. And you ask yourself, then, which features of what I am seeing, are making it so beautiful?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 3|What will generate tranquility? The essence of it is pretty simple, but requires much concentration. Stand in the place. Ask yourself what you should put there - a certain stone on the mantel, a color on a piece of wall, the shape of an opening. For any of these, you ask, does it generate greater tranquility in me? If it does, keep it. If it does not, reject it. Keep on doing that, for everything around you. And then, get rid of everything else.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|...the underlying design vocabulary of the 20th century, almost throughout the century, asserted that designers should create structures that are "interesting", "pleasing", "fantastic", "exhilarating", "with elan", and so on - anything but em(beautiful). em(That) word has unalterable meaning, cannot be contaminated, and during the temporary insanity of the 20th century, struck a nerve which people could not tolerate.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|What is the reason for this "food-like" character of the making process? Why should it matter so much, whether a person makes something beautiful or not? Why should it have such a profound effect on the maker?
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|In order to create living structure, we must please ourselves....And you need em(only) please yourself. But you must please yourself em(truly).
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|It is very, very hard to make a beautiful building.
Christopher Alexander|The Nature of Order, Book 4|I try to shape the volume such that its volume brings tears to my throat...This sadness of tears, when I reach it, is also joy.
Christopher Alexander|The Timeless Way of Building|Here there is no mastery of unnameable creative processes: only the patience of a craftsman, chipping away slowly; the mastery of what is made does not lie in the depths of some impenetrable ego; it lies, instead, in the simple mastery of the steps in the process, and in the definition of these steps.
Christopher Alexander|The Timeless Way of Building|The simple process by which people generate a living building, simply by walking it out, waving their arms, thinking together, placing stakes in the ground, will always touch them deeply.

That punishment included more than a hundred rapes by perpetrators, some of whom quoted the Quran while beating her.

It's so hard for them to accept that they are willing to kill me for it." [Seyran Ates]

Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|...ordinary reading, slow and uniform, strikes them [digital natives] as incompatible, alien. It isn't just boring and obsolete. It's irritating.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Few things are worse for adolescent minds than overblown appraisals of their merits.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|The more mentors have engaged youth in youth terms, though, the more youth have disengaged from the mentors themselves and from the culture they are supposed to represent.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|The 18-year-old may have a Visa card, cell phone, My Space page, part-time job, Play Station 2, and an admissions letter to State U., but ask this wired and on-the-go high school senior a few intellectual questions and the facade of in-the-knowness crumbles.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|For all their technological adroitness, they don't read or write or divide very well.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Fully 45 percent of the students just don't think leisure reading is important ("a little" or "not at all"). Unconvinced of what adult readers feel deep in their hearts and know from long experience, nearly half of the student body disregards books by choice and disposition, and they don't expect to suffer for it. In their minds, a-literacy and anti-intellectualism pose no career obstacles, and they have no shame attached.

Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|In an average young person's online experience, the senses may be stimulated and the ego touched, but vocabulary doesn't expand, memory doesn't improve, analytic talents don't develop, and erudition doesn't ensue.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|If the guardians of tradition claim that the young, though ignorant, have a special perspective on the past, or if teachers prize the impulses of tenth-graders more than the thoughts of the wise and the works of the masters, learning loses its point. The thread of intellectual inheritance snaps.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Over the years, the indulgence of youth circulated among educators and settled into sanctioned pedagogy with a predictable result: not an unleashing of independent, creative, skeptical mental energies of rising students, but what we have seen in previous chapters, routine irreverence and knowledge deficits.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|In 1959, political philosopher Leo Strauss defined liberal education as "the counter-poison to mass culture". A history professor who agrees with this view today becomes a fuddy-duddy in his own department.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Spend some hours in school zones and you see that the indulgent attitude toward youth, along with the downplaying of tradition, has reached the point of dogma among teachers, reporters, researchers, and creators in arts and humanitarian fields, and pro-knowledge, pro-tradition conceptions strike them as bluntly unpleasant, if not reactionary and out of touch.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|Confidence and enjoyment don't guarantee better students. Furthermore, they prevent the students from forming one of the essential ingredients of long-term success: an accurate, realistic appraisal of their present capacities.
Mark Bauerlein|The Dumbest Generation|A predictable descent commenced. The sixties generation's leaders didn't anticipate how their claim of exceptionalism would affect the next generation, and the next, but the sequence was entirely logical. Informed rejection of the past became uninformed rejection of the past, and then the complete and unworried ignorance of it.

Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|This artificial method of communicating thought, we now behold carried to the highest perfection. Language is become a vehicle by which the most delicate and refined emotions of one mind can be transmitted, or, if we may so speak, transfused into another. Not only are names given to all objects around us, by which means an easy and speedy intercourse is carried on for providing the necessaries of life, but all the relations and differences among these objects are minutely marked, the invisible sentiments of the mind are described, the most abstract notions and conceptions are rendered intelligible; and all the ideas which science can discover, or imagination create, are known by their proper names... The object is become familiar; and, like the expanse of the firmament, and other great objects, which we are accustomed to behold, we behold it without wonder.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|And hence, if our Language, by reason of the simple arrangement of its words, possesses less harmony, less beauty, and less force, than the Greek or Latin; it is, however, in its meaning, more obvious and plain.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|...we must not forget to observe, that spoken language has a great superiority over written language, in point of energy or force. The voice of the living speaker makes impression on the mind, much stronger than can be made by the perusal of any writing.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|em(It), is the most general term that can possibly be conceived, as it may stand for any one thing in the universe of which we speak.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The Greek, which is the most perfect of all the known tongues, is very regular and complete in all the moods and tenses. The Latin, though formed on the same model, is not so perfect; particularly in the passive voice, which forms most of the tenses, by the help of the auxiliary "sum".
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|It [French] is, perhaps, the happiest language for conversation, in the known world; but on the higher subjects of composition, the English may be justly esteemed greatly to excel it considerably.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|Perspicuity, it will be readily admitted, is the fundamental quality of Style; a quality so essential in every kind of Writing, that for the want of it, nothing can atone. Without this, the richest ornaments of Style only glimmer through the dark; and puzzle instead of pleasing the reader. This, therefore, must be our first object, to make our meaning clearly and fully understood, and understood without the least difficulty. "Discourse" says Quintilian, "ought always to be obvious, even to the most careless and negligent hearer, so that the sense shall strike his mind, as the light of the sun does our eyes, though they are not directed upwards to it. We must study, not only that every hearer may understand us, but that it shall be impossible for him not to understand us."
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|We are pleased with an author, we consider him as deserving praise, who frees us from all fatigue of searching for his meaning; who carries us through his subject without any embarrassment or confusion; whose style flows always like a limpid stream, where we see to the very bottom.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|A multitude of Latin words have of late been poured in upon us.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The words which a man uses to express his ideas, may be faulty in three respects; they may either not express that idea which the author intends, but some other which only resembles, or is akin to it; or, they may express that idea, but not quite fully and completely; or, they may express it, together with something more than he intends. Precision stands opposed to all these three faults; but chiefly to the last.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|The use and importance of Precision, may be deduced from the nature of the human mind. It never can view, clearly and distinctly, above one object at a time.
Hugh Blair|Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|Thought and language act and re-act upon each other mutually. Logic and rhetoric have here, as in many other cases, a strict connexion; and he that is learning to arrange his sentences with accuracy and order, is learning, at the same time, to think with accuracy and order...

Richard Brodie|Virus of the Mind|To the universe, there's no em(you), or human beings, or giraffes, or solar systems, or galaxies. All those are human-invented distinctions. They are all memes.
Richard Brodie|Virus of the Mind|Our minds excel at copying information and at following instructions. Remember the four characteristics of a virus: penetration, copying, possibly issuing instructions, and spreading. As horrifying as the thought may be initially, our minds are ideally susceptible to infection by mind viruses.
Richard Brodie|Virus of the Mind|Memes involving danger, food, and sex spread faster than other memes because we are wired to pay more attention to them - we have em(buttons) around those subjects.
Richard Brodie|Virus of the Mind|The ideas that spread the easiest, and therefore pervade society, are the ones that easily penetrate that old Stone-Age brain of ours. The whole of science has been a concerted effort to em(foil) that natural selection of Stone-Age ideas by our brains and instead select ideas that are useful, that work, that are accurate models of reality.

C. Singer et. al.|A History of Technology|The restriction of the various Semitic alphabets to consonants is difficult to explain, but it must be remembered that the structure of all the Semitic languages rests on the basis of consonantal bi-lateral or tri-lateral roots. These give the essential conception of the word, the vowels only providing the relations, case, tense, mood, and so forth [swim, swam, swum].
C. Singer et. al.|A History of Technology|The Egyptians of the Old Kingdom had discovered the principle of expressing a single sound, whether consonant or vowel, by a single sign. Owing to their intense conservatism, they did not fully use it.

C. Singer et. al.|A History of Technology|An analysis of the better-defined tools from Choukoutien has shown that the majority were chipped by right-handed persons. Monkeys and apes are usually indifferent to which hand they use, and the acquisition of greater skill in the one hand is a human trait linked with the dominance of one side of the brain, and doubtless connected with the habitual use of tools. Ninety-five percent of modern adult human beings are right-handed, but left-handedness was commoner in earlier times, as it is still among untrained infants.

Mme Campan|Mémoires|Je rentrai chez moi pour écrire cette conversation.
Mme Campan|Mémoires|Puisque la fortune est si volage et que vous avez vu par vos propres yeux avec quelle rapidité elle abandonne ses favoris, n'oubliez jamais ces deux vers de La Fontaine, et qu'ils vous servent de devise: em(Travaillez, prenez de la peine; C'est le fonds qui manque le moins.)
Mme Campan|Mémoires|Voici un trait vraiment touchant qu'on raconte du jeune dauphin que la mort nous a enlevé. Ce prince étant tombé en langeur de la maladie dont il est mort, avait toujours témoigné beaucoup d'affection à M. de Bourset, son valet de chambre. Il lui demanda un jour des ciseaux; ce gentilhomme lui représenta que cela lui était défendu. L'enfant insista avec douceur, et l'on fut obligé de lui céder. Muni des ciseaux qu'il désirait, il s'en servit pour se couper une boucle de cheveux qu'il enveloppa avec soin dans une feuille de papier: "Tenez, Monsieur, dit-il à son valet de chambre, voilà le seul présent que je puisse vous faire, n'ayant rien à ma disposition; mais quand je serai mort, vous présenterez ce gage à mon papa et à maman; en se souvenant de moi, j'espère qu'ils se souviendront de vous." [Le dauphin avait 7 ans.]
Mme Campan|Mémoires|C'était particulièrement contre la reine que l'insurrection était dirigée: je frémis encore en me souvenant que les poissardes, ou plutôt les furies qui portaient des tabliers blancs, criaient qu'ils étaient destinés à recevoir les entrailles de Marie-Antoinette; qu'elles s'en feraient des cocardes, et mêlaient les expressions les plus obscènes à ces horribles menaces; tant l'ignorance et la cruauté, qui se trouvent dans le masse de presque tous les peuples, peuvent dans les temps de troubles leur inspirer des sentiments atroces!
Mme Campan|Mémoires|Le chevalier de Dampierre avait été tué près de la voiture du roi, en sortant de Varennes. Un pauvre curé de village, à quelques lieues de l'endroit où ce crime venait d'être commis, eut l'imprudence de s'approcher pour parler au roi; les cannibales qui environnaient la voiture se jettent sur lui. "Tigres, leur cria Barnave, avez-vous cessé d'être Français? Nation de braves, êtes-vous devenue un peuple d'assassins?..." Ces seules paroles sauvèrent d'une mort certaine le curé déjà terrassé. Barnave, en les prononçant, s'était jeté presque hors la portière, et madame Élisabeth, touchée de ce noble élan, le retenait par la basque de son habit.
Mme Campan|Mémoires|La grande piété de madame Élisabeth donnaient à ses actions et à ses discours une noblesse qui peignait celle de son ame. Le jour où l'on immola cette digne descendante de saint Louis, le bourreau, en lui attachant les mains derrière le dos, releva une des pointes du devant de son fichu. Madame Élisabeth, avec un calme et une voix qui semblait ne pas venir de la terre, lui dit ces mots: "Au nom de la pudeur, couvrez-moi le sein." J'ai appris ce trait héroïque de madame de Sérilly, condamnée le même jour que la princesse, mais qui obtint un sursis au moment de l'exécution, madame de Montmorin, sa parente, ayant déclaré que sa cousine était grosse.

M. Capek|The New Aspects of Time|Yet, the very persistence of such misinterpretations [of SR] must have some deep, underlying cause which a historian of ideas can easily identify: the perennial tradition of both Western and Eastern thought which regards time as merely apparent and not genuinely real.
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|The intensity of every astonishment gradually wears off; the human mind, by the sheer effect of repetition and habit, gradually becomes accustomed to even the strangest and least familiar ideas.
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|It frequently happens that within one and the same mind the true grasp of the mathematical side of the theory coexists with serious misapprehensions of its physical and especially its philosophical meaning....
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|This plainly shows that the term "curvature" is essentially metaphorical, for it is based on an analogy with curvature of two-dimensional surfaces.
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|...the law of gravitation is a generalized law of inertia.
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|What is left of the classical definition of space as "simultaneous juxtaposition of points?" Nothing but a word with misleading connotations.
M. Capek|The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics|Yet the idea of a timeless container, in which all matter is located and in which all motion takes place, has such deep roots in the very structure of human imagination that it is almost impossible to get rid of it.

Richard Dawkins|The God Delusion|I have found it an amusing strategy, when asked whether I am an atheist, to point out that the questioner is also an atheist when considering Zeus, Apollo, Amon Ra, Mithras, Baal, Thor, Wotan, the Golden Calf and the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|A recurring theme is that the other Westerners and I are struck by the emotional security, self-confidence, curiosity, and autonomy of members of small-scale societies, not only as adults but already as children.
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|In 1931 no New Guinean born in Goroka had ever visited Wapenamanda a mere 107 miles to the west; the idea of traveling from Goroka to Wapenamanda, without being killed by an unknown stranger within the first 10 miles from Goroka, would have been unthinkable.
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|"People are basically the same everywhere." No, I eventually came to realize, in many basic ways we are not all the same....
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|...the independence, security, and social maturity of children in traditional societies impress all visitors who have come to know them.

Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|Ever since my first trip to New Guinea, I have been impressed by how much more time New Guineans spend talking with each other than do we Americans and Europeans.... Talking is the main form of entertainment in New Guinea.
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|As a result, food is a major and almost constant subject of conversation...The significance of sex and food is reversed between the Siriono and us Westerners; the Siriono's strongest anxieties are about food, they have sex virtually whenever they want, and sex compensates for food hunger, while our strongest anxieties are about sex, we have food virtually whenever we want, and eating compensates for sexual frustration.
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|Among those 20 New Guineans, the smallest number of languages that anyone spoke was 5. Several men spoke from 8 to 12 languages, and the champion was a man who spoke 16.
Jared Diamond|The World Until Yesterday|For instance, no one in the densely populated mountain valleys of the main body of New Guinea had seen or even heard of the ocean, lying at a distance of only 50 to 120 miles.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|Goto Statement Considered Harmful|...our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer|Perhaps the most saddening thing now is that, even after all those years of frustrating experience, still so many people honestly believe that some law of nature tells us that machines have to be that way. They silence their doubts by observing how many of these machines have been sold, and derive from that observation the false sense of security that, after all, the design cannot have been that bad. But upon closer inspection, that line of defense has the same convincing strength as the argument that cigarette smoking must be healthy because so many people do it.
Edsger W. Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer|We should recognise the closed subroutine as one of the greatest software inventions; it has survived three generations of computers, and it will survive a few more, because it caters for the implementation of one of our basic patterns of abstraction.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Question - who is he? Answer - a loafer. I must say it would have been a real pleasure to have heard that said about myself, for it would have meant that a positive definition had been found for me and that there was something one could say about me. "A loafer!" - why, it's a title, a purpose in life. It's a career, gentlemen, a career!
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Let us suppose, gentlemen, that man is not stupid... But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful. Phenomenally ungrateful. I'm even inclined to believe that the best definition of man is - a creature who walks on two legs and is ungrateful.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|Is it not possible that man loves something besides prosperity? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? ...Whether it is good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant to smash things too.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Notes From the Underground|What is an insult but a sort of purification?
Fyodor Dostoyevsky|White Knights|For, after all, you do grow up, you do outgrow your ideals, which turn to dust and ashes, which are shattered into fragments; and if you have no other life, you just have to build one up out of these fragments. And all the time your soul is craving and longing for something else. And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking in these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!

Will and Ariel Durant|The Age of Napolean|Napolean: "The women are everywhere - at plays, on public walks, in libraries. You see very pretty women in the scholar's study room. Only here [in Paris], of all the places on Earth, do women deserve such influence, and indeed the men are mad about them, think of nothing else, and live only through and for them. A woman, in order to know what is due her, and what power she has, must live in Paris for six months."
Will and Ariel Durant|The Age of Napolean|The "Fourth Estate" - the journalists and the press - may have been more influential than the schools in forming the mind and mood of France in those effervescent years.
Will and Ariel Durant|The Age of Napolean|[In England] until 1929 the legal age of marriage was fourteen for the male, twelve for the female.
Will and Ariel Durant|The Age of Napolean|The em(Vindication) [Wollstonecraft] proceeded to list some feminine faults of that time: the admiration of weakness and timidity, which feeds and pleases the male's assumption of superiority; the addiction to cards, gossip, astrology, sentimentality, and literary trash; the absorption in dress and self-admiration.
Will and Ariel Durant|The Age of Napolean|Coleridge, about 1798, complained convincingly: "I am pestered every ball night to dance, which very em(modestly) I refuse.

Timothy Findlay|NULL|...Shem did nothing but eat and work and sleep. He thought of nothing else but these three things and was devoid of wonder.
Raymond Firth|Tikopia Ritual and Belief|The reasons for sorcery are mainly those of economics or of personal status; desire for land; wish to punish for theft of food; jealousy of competitive achievement; resentment at a personal affront.
F. Scott Fitzgerald|The Great Gatsby|I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence.
F. Scott Fitzgerald|The Great Gatsby|When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.
F. Scott Fitzgerald|The Great Gatsby|"Can't repeat the past?" he cried incredulously. "Why of course you can!"
F. Scott Fitzgerald|The Great Gatsby|"Her voice is full of money," he said suddenly.
Quinto Orazio Flacco|NULL|Ciò che cerchiamo o è qui o in nessun luogo.
Flammarion and Gore|Popular Astronomy|Writers who know nothing of the true poetry of modern science have supposed that the perception of the sublime is born of ignorance, and that to admire, it is necessary not to know. This is assuredly a strange error...
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Il trouvait que le bonheur mérité par l'excellence de son âme tardait à venir.
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|...il accompagnait une femme d'une cinquantaine d'années, laide, magnifiquement vêtue, et d'un rang social problématique.
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Les cœurs des femmes sont comme ces petits meubles à secret, pleins de tiroirs emboîtés les uns dans les autres; on se donne du mal, on se casse les ongles, et on trouve au fond quelque fleur desséchée, des brins de poussière ou le vide!
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Après avoir passé successivement par la demi-tasse, le grog, le bischof, le vin chaud et même l'eau rougie, il était revenu à la bière; et, de demi-heure en demi-heure, laissait tomber ce mot : «Bock!», ayant réduit son langage à l'indispensable.
Gustave Flaubert|L'éducation sentimentale|Des années passèrent; et il supportait le désoeuvrement de son intelligence et l'inertie de son coeur.
Gustave Flaubert|Lettre à Guy de Maupassant|Je ne sais pas si vous avez du talent. Ce que vous m'avez apporté prouve une certaine intelligence, mais n'oubliez point ceci, jeune homme, que le talent - suivant le mot de Buffon - n'est qu'une longue patience. Travaillez.
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|À la ville, avec le bruit des rues, le bourdonnement des théâtres et les clartés du bal, elles avaient des existences où le cœur se dilate, où les sens s'épanouissent. Mais elle, sa vie était froide comme un grenier dont la lucarne est au nord, et l'ennui, araignée silencieuse, filait sa toile dans l'ombre à tous les coins de son cœur.
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|Quel bonheur dans ce temps-là! quelle liberté! quel espoir! quelle abondance d'illusions!
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|Emma ressemblait à toutes les maîtresses; et le charme de la nouveauté, peu à peu tombant comme un vêtement, laissait voir à nu l'éternelle monotonie de la passion, qui a toujours les mêmes formes et le même langage.
Gustave Flaubert|Madame Bovary|...chaque notaire porte en soi les débris d'un poète.

Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|Le bonheur est une monstruosité! punis sont ceux qui le cherchent.
Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|La médiocrité chérit la regle, moi je la hais...
Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|La rage de vouloir conclure est une des manies les plus funestes et les plus stériles qui appartiennent à l'humanité. Chaque religion et chaque philosophie a prétendu avoir Dieu à elle, toiser l'infini et connaître la recette du bonheur. Quel orgueil et quel néant! Je vois, au contraire, que les plus grands génies et les plus grandes œuvres n'ont jamais conclu. Homère, Shakespeare, Goethe, tous les fils aînés de Dieu (comme dit Michelet) se sont bien gardés de faire autre chose que représenter.
Gustave Flaubert|Pensées|Il n'y a pour moi dans le monde que les beaux vers, les phrases bien tournées, harmonieuses, chantantes, les beaux couchers de soleil, les clairs de lune, les tableaux colorés, les marbres antiques et les têtes accentuées. Au delà, rien.

Gustave Flaubert|NULL|J'ai entrevue quelquefois (dans mes grands jours de soleil)... un état de l'âme ainsi supérieur à la vie, pour qui la gloire ne serait rien, et le bonheur même inutile.
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|To be stupid, and selfish, and to have good health are the three requirements for happiness; though if stupidity is lacking, the others are useless.
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|I'm like a piece of wood, which I don't mind in the least. Passion, excitement being what I dread, I think that if happiness is to be found anywhere it's in stagnation.
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|...the humiliations that adjectives inflict on me, the cruel ravages of the relative pronoun...
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|May I die like a dog rather than try to rush through even one sentence before it is perfectly ripe.
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|...I had written myself into a state, and it was immensely enjoyable... a state of the soul so far above ordinary life, a state in which fame counts for nothing, and even happiness is irrelevant.
Gustave Flaubert|NULL|I have been attacked by the government, by the priests and by the newspapers. My triumph is complete.

Samuel Foote|The Comic Theatre|What surprise! - what joy! - what confusion! - Support me, Subtle! I am unable to bear this conflict of tumultuous passions!
E. M. Forster|Other Kingdom|Other Kingdom copse is just like any other beech copse, and I am therefore spared the fatigue of describing it.

Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|In the old days, craftsmen did not cut corners. They worked carefully, and they took care with every aspect of their work. Every part of the product was considered, and each was designed and made to be exactly as it should be. These craftsmen did not relax their thoughtful self-discipline even with respect to features of their work that would ordinarily not be visible. Although no one would notice if those features were not quite right, the craftsmen would be bothered by their consciences. So nothing was swept under the rug. Or, one might perhaps also say, there was no bullshit.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|Her statement is not germane to the enterprise of describing reality.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|It is just his lack of connection with a concern with truth - this indifference to how things really are - that I regard as the essence of bullshit.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|For the essence of bullshit is not that it is em(false) but that it is em(phony).
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|The problem of understanding why our attitude toward bullshit is generally more benign than our attitude toward lying is an important one, which I shall leave as an exercise for the reader.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction.
Harry Frankfurt|On Bullshit|[The bullshitter] does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.
J. G. Frazer|The Golden Bough|Whatever doubts science may entertain as to the possibility of action at a distance, magic has none...
J. G. Frazer|The Golden Bough|...may we not reasonably conjecture that...just as on the material side of human culture there has everywhere been an Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere been an Age of Magic?
J. G. Frazer|The Golden Bough|This universal faith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in the efficacy of magic. While religious systems differ not only in different countries, but in the same country in different ages, the system of sympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all times substantially alike in its principles and practice.
Matti Friedman|Spies of No Country|Now, Gambiel wrote in one dispatch, "the newspapers describe the Jew in the most barbaric and cruel fashion, and also as weak and cowardly." Many people, he reported, believed that Jews "were slaughtering children and abusing pregnant women and raping virgins." The word "Jew" was starting to assume demonic undertones.
Matti Friedman|Spies of No Country|The population grew by a percentage point every 10 days.
Matti Friedman|Spies of No Country|Syrian papers reported a freeze on Jewish bank accounts and a government demand for a list of their assets.

François Garnier|L'âne à la lyre|On a pu constater que la reprise des erreurs était si fréquente que le phénomène de répétition crée une forme apparente de vérité, pernicieuse et tenace.
Gauss|Letter to Sophie Germain (1807)|The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a woman, who because of her sex and our prejudices encounters infinitely more obstacles than a man in familiarizing herself with complicated problems, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|His manners were less pure, but his character was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness, assured the ambassadors that, unless their master acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render Persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Confiscation, exile, or simple death, were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|The peace of the Eastern church was invaded by a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or humanity; and the Imperial troops acknowledged, without shame, that they were much less apprehensive of an encounter with the fiercest barbarians.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|...the severity of the [Church] fathers, who despised all knowledge that was not useful to salvation, and who considered all levity of discourse as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech.
Edward Gibbon|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|But it is always easy, as well as agreeable, for the inferior ranks of mankind to claim a merit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach.

André Gide|Les nourritures terrestres|At last we end by saying that He - the Unfindable - is everywhere, anywhere, and kneel down at haphazard.
André Gide|Les nourritures terrestres|There were days when simply repeating to myself that two and two still made four was enough to fill me with positive beatitude... and other days when it was completely indifferent to me.
André Gide|Les nourritures terrestres|Books had taught me that every liberty is provisional and never anything but the power to choose one's slavery.

Jean Giradoux|Ondine|A babord le néant, à tribord l'oubli...
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|The principle source of violence between human beings is mimetic rivalry, the rivalry resulting from imitation of a [role] model...
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|In short,... a paradox occurs: the antagonists resemble one another more and more... They have ears only for the deceptive celebration of differences, which rages more than ever in our societies, not because real differences are increasing but because they are disappearing.
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|The synoptic gospels use em(satan/satanas) and em(diabolos) interchangeably and with equal frequency... Both words refer to one who accuses, slanders, denounces, and seduces.
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|The peoples of the world do not invent their gods. They deify their victims.
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|A great mass of evidence, theoretical, textual, and archeological, suggests that in the beginnings of humanity the sacrificial victims were human.
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|Human communities constantly resort to sacrifice to ease their distress.
Réné Girard|I See Satan Fall Like Lightning|Unanimity in human groups is rarely a vehicle of truth; more often it is nothing but a mimetic, tyrannical phenomena. It resembles elections in totalitarian countries.
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|Once mobilized, the crowd has absolute power, dragging institutions with it until they are forced to disintegrate.
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|...I intend to show that all myths must have their roots in real acts of real violence against real victims.
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|The causality of magic is one with mythology, so the importance of its denial cannot be exaggerated.
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|...the Gospels reveal the scapegoat mechanism everywhere, even within us.
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|em(They do not know what they are doing.) In this passage [from the Passion] we are given the first definition of the unconscious in human history...
Réné Girard|The Scapegoat|The constituted authorities give in to [the mob] and yield up the victims demanded by their caprice, just as Pilate gave up Jesus or Herod John the Baptist.
Peter Godfrey-Smith|Theory and Reality|Although mathematics is clearly of huge importance in the development of physics, one of the greatest achievements in all of science - Darwin's achievement in em(On the Origin of Species) - makes no real use of mathematics.
Peter Godfrey-Smith|Theory and Reality|For Popper, an inspiring example of genuine science was the work of Einstein. Examples of pseudo-science were Freudian psychology and Marxist views about society and history.
Peter Godfrey-Smith|Theory and Reality|And crucially, for Popper it is never possible to confirm or establish a theory by showing its agreement with observations. em(Confirmation is a myth.) The only thing that an observational test can do is to show that a theory is false.
Peter Godfrey-Smith|Theory and Reality|The humanities had gone to hell, and now they were trying to wreck science as well, via endless relativist bleating that science is "just another approach to knowledge with no special status."

I. A. Goncharov|Oblomov|Lying down was not for Ilya Ilyitch either a necessity as it is for a sick or a sleepy man, or an occasional need as it is for a person who is tired, or a pleasure as it is for a sluggard: it was his normal state.
I. A. Goncharov|Oblomov|He was never held captive by the beauties, however, never was their slave or even a very assiduous admirer, if only because intimacy with a woman involves a lot of exertion.
I. A. Goncharov|Oblomov|Masha came to ask him if he would like to go and see the river freezing: everyone was going.
I. A. Goncharov|Oblomov|Their sensitive minds were never tired of this beauty: the earth, the sky, the sea - all roused their feelings, and they sat side by side in silence, looking with one heart at the glory of creation.
Edmond et Jules de Goncourt|Germinie Lacerteux|Pendant des mois, elle resta insensible à tout; pendant des mois, envahie et remplie tout entière par la pensée du petit être qui n'était plus, elle porta dans ses entrailles la mort de son enfant comme elle avait porté sa vie.
Edmond et Jules de Goncourt|Renée Mauperin|That great force, Fashion, which in Paris affects everything, even a priest's cassock, had taken him up and launched him. People came to him from all parts. The ordinary, commonplace confessions were heard by other priests, but all the choice sins were brought to him.
Edmond et Jules de Goncourt|Renée Mauperin|Why, yes, I should like to be rich just to show the contempt I have for money.
Glenn Gould|NULL|The purpose of art is the lifelong creation of a state of wonder.
Muriel Gray|NULL|But it has never been clearer that there is only one place to lay the blame [for 9/11] and it has ever been thus. The cause of all this misery, mayhem, violence, terror and ignorance is of course religion itself, and if it seems ludicrous to have to state such an obvious reality, the fact is that the government and the media are doing a pretty good job of pretending that it isn't so.
Philip Greenspan|NULL|[Having venture capitalists run your company] was like watching a kindergarten class get into a Boeing 747 and flip all the switches and try to figure out why it didn't take off.
Germaine Greer|NULL|In any library in the world, I am at home, unselfconscious, still, and absorbed.
Alexander Grothendieck|Récoltes et semailles|It is in this gesture of "going beyond", to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one - it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All other things follow as a matter of course.
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|Writing thus facilitated the appearance of powerful fictional entities...
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|This obstacle was finally removed about 5,000 years ago, when the Sumerians invented both writing and money. These Siamese twins - born to the same parents at the same time and in the same place - broke the data-processing limitations of the human brain.
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|...witnesses in courts put their hand on a bible when swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It's ironic that they swear to tell the truth on a book brimming with so many fictions, myths, and errors.
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|Stories serve as the foundations and pillars of human societies. As history unfolded, stories about gods, nations, and corporations grew so powerful that they began to dominate objective reality.
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance.
Yuval Harari|Homo Deus|We see that the self too is an imaginary story, just like nations, gods and money. Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples... and out of all that jumble it weaves a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from and where I am going.
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|How did em(Homo sapiens) manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants, and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|According to the French legislators, if a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper, and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus - a new company was incorporated.
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word em(domesticate) comes from the Latin em(domus), which means em(house). Who's the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It's the em(Sapiens).
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|Money was created many times in many places. Its development required no technological breakthroughs - it was a purely mental revolution. It involved the creation of a new inter-subjective reality that exists solely in people's imagination.
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|There is no trace of [the belief in heaven and hell] in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body.
Yuval Harari|Sapiens|These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.
Yuval Harari|NULL|There is no clear line. The whole thing works by being a bit opaque, cloudy, misty, and unclear. We think that the world is divided quite clearly; there is fiction and there is reality; but usually they just get mixed together.
Thomas Hardy|A Group of Noble Dames|After this they lived quietly and uneventfully for two or three years at Sir Ashley Mattisfont's residence in that part of England, with as near an approach to bliss as the climate of this country allows.
Thomas Hardy|A Pair of Blue Eyes|A delightful place to be buried in, postulating that delight can accompany a man to his tomb under any circumstances.
Thomas Hardy|A Pair of Blue Eyes|...the eternal hills and tower behind them were grayish-brown; the sky, dropping behind all, grey of the purest melancholy.
Thomas Hardy|A Pair of Blue Eyes|I always did doubt a man's being a gentleman if his palate has no acquired tastes. An unedified palate is the irrepressible cloven foot of the upstart.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|...and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry, sandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel color, between that of guano and Roman cement, making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet sea-weed round a boulder after the ebb.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|The dog took no notice, for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath - in fact, he never barked even at the sheep except to order, when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Commination-service which, though offensive, had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|Seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her person, she edged off around the bush.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|...a young married man, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as "Susan Tall's husband".
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|Kiss my foot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.
Thomas Hardy|Far From the Madding Crowd|The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman. No man who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or squirrel in his childhood, could possibly have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean bread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and compelled Jude to smother higher thinkings under immediate needs.
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species...
Thomas Hardy|Jude the Obscure|Here he stood, looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual sing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's groan.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|He himself was full of vague latter-day glooms and popular melancholies.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|There were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between "Mop" and the career of a second Paganini.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive organization.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|...his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts.
Thomas Hardy|Life's Little Ironies|Too steady-going to be "a buck" (as fast and unmarried men were then called), he was an approximately fashionable man of mild type.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|He had been a lad of whom something was expected. Beyond this all had been chaos. That he would be successful in an original way, or that he would go to the dogs in an original way, seemed equally probable. The only absolute certainty about him was that he would not stand still in the circumstances amid which he was born.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|He had reached the stage in a young man's life when the grimness of the general human situation first becomes clear; and the realization of this causes ambition to halt awhile. In France it is not uncustomary to commit suicide at this stage; in England we do much better, or much worse, as  the case may be.
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|There is a certain degree and tone of light which tends to disturb the equilibrium of the senses, and to promote dangerously the tenderer moods...
Thomas Hardy|The Return of the Native|But I am getting used to the horror of my existence.
Thomas Hardy|The Trumpet-Major|He threw fictitiousness into his very gait, even now, when there was nobody to see him, and struck out at stems of wild parsley with his regimental switch as he had used to do when soldiering was new to him, and life in general a charming experience.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|For answer she ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|As in most villages so secluded as this, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the inhabitants...
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|...with a sudden start he worked on, climbing higher into the sky, and cutting himself off more and more from all intercourse with the sublunary world.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|Grace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved onward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her eyes wet.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|The young lady remained in his thoughts. He might have followed her; but he was not constitutionally active, and preferred a conjectural pursuit.
Thomas Hardy|The Woodlanders|Fitzpiers examined so closely that his breath touched her tenderly, at which their eyes rose to an encounter - hers showing themselves as deep and mysterious as interstellar space.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|"Well!", said Mrs. Penny, flopping into a chair, "my heart hasn't been in such a thumping state of uproar since I used to sit up on old Midsummer-eves to see who my husband was going to be."
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|"I fancy I've seen him look across at Miss Day in a warmer way than Christianity asked for..."
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|...it was an accepted thing that Leaf didn't in the least mind having no head, that deficiency of his being an unimpassioned matter of parish history.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|Thereupon he plunged in his hands, and they paddled together. It being the first time in his life that he touched female fingers under water, Dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one.
Thomas Hardy|Under the Greenwood Tree|...they were never to be seen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinking - a local English custom of extraordinary antiquity, but stated by Fancy to be decidedly dying out among the better classes of society.
William Hazlitt|NULL|The studied forms of politeness do not give the greatest possible scope to an exuberance of wit and fancy. The fear of giving offence destroys sincerity, and without sincerity there can be no true enjoyment of society, nor unfettered exertion of intellectual activity.
Hegel|NULL|Magic has existed among all peoples and at every period.
Elisabeth Heisenberg|Inner Exile|"In the first moment, I was deeply shaken. I had the sensation of looking through the surface of atomic phenomena at a distant foundation of a strange inner beauty, and the thought that I was to probe this wealth of mathematical structures that nature had spread out before me down below almost made me dizzy. I was far too agitated to sleep. And so, with dawn beginning to break, I left the house and headed for the southern tip of the island, to where a solitary tower of rocks jutting out into the sea had kindled my desire to climb it. I reached for the top without too much difficulty, and waited for the sun to rise."
Werner Heisenberg|Physics and Philosophy|..what we observe in nature is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.
Werner Heisenberg|Physics and Philosophy|The idea that electromagnetic waves could be a reality in themselves, independent of any bodies, did at that time not occur to the physicists.

The new pedagogies designed to "educate boys more like girls" (in Gloria Steinem's phrase) are not harmless. Their approach to boys is unacceptably meddlesome, and even subtly abusive.
Christina Hoff-Somers|The War Against Boys|An unacknowledged animus against boys is loose in our society.

Leopold Infeld|Quest|This law [objects all fall at the same speed], so simple that it is nearly obvious, is only three hundred years old!
Leopold Infeld|Quest|To ponder a problem for ten years without any encouragement from the outside world requires strength of character. This strength of character, perhaps more than his great intuition and imagination, lead to Einstein's scientific achievements.
Leopold Infeld|Quest|We are slaves to bathrooms, frigidaires, cars, radios, and millions of other things. Einstein tried to reduce them to the absolute minimum.
Leopold Infeld|Quest|But through all the stream of events, the impact of people and social life forced upon him, Einstein remains lonely, loving solitude, isolation, and conditions which secure undisturbed work.
Jane Jacobs|The Death and Life of Great American Cities|As in the pseudoscience of bloodletting, just so in the pseudoscience of city rebuilding and planning, years of learning and a plethora of subtle and complicated dogma have arisen on a foundation of nonsense.

Henry Kamen|The Spanish Inquisition|By the end of the sixteenth century there were no professors of mathematics in Alcala or Salamanca.
Kershner and Wilcox|The Anatomy of Mathematics|The practical use of mathematics has an importance which it would be foolish to deny. Without mathematics such amenities of modern civilization such as elevators, automatic cigarette vending machines and atomic bombs could not have been developed.
Kershner and Wilcox|The Anatomy of Mathematics|The need to recognize the existence of an undefined basis [assumptions] cannot be overemphasized.
Kershner and Wilcox|The Anatomy of Mathematics|It is regrettable that mathematical words should have other meanings as well, since a nonmathematical meaning tends to influence understanding of the mathematical meaning. Thus, em(set), em(function), em(relation), and em(operation) have mathematical meanings that are entirely, or almost entirely, divorced from their everyday meanings. The reader should not expect em(real numbers) to be any more real, or any less imaginary, than em(imaginary) numbers. There is nothing even remotely irrational about em(irrational numbers). These are all equally straightforward mathematical entities which happen to be unfortunately named.
Kershner and Wilcox|The Anatomy of Mathematics|By a number, then, until further notice, we shall mean one of a particular collection of grunts (differing with the language) associated with the ritual of counting.

Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|The initial battle between Copernicus and the astronomers of antiquity was fought over technical minutiae...
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|Copernicus himself believed in neither [infinite space nor the possibility of a vacuum]. As we shall see, he tried to preserve most of the central features of Aristotelian and Ptolemaic cosmology.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|Copernicus...belonged to the minority group of Renaissance astronomers who did not cast horoscopes.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|em(De Revolutionibus)...is a relatively staid, sober, and unrevolutionary work.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|Copernicus' system is neither simpler nor more accurate than Ptolemy's.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|The significance of em(De Revolutionibus) lies, then, less than in what it says itself than in what it caused others to say. The book gave rise to a revolution that it had scarcely enunciated.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|The Copernican Revolution, as we know it, is scarcely to be found in the em(De Revolutionibus) and that is the second essential incongruity of the text.
Thomas S. Kuhn|The Copernican Revolution|During the century and a half following Galileo's death in 1642, a belief in the earth-centered universe was gradually transformed from an essential sign of sanity to an index, first, of inflexible conservatism, then of excessive parochialism, and finally of complete fanaticism.

Henry Charles Lea|A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages|In such a religion the priest exercises the functions which in purer faiths are relegated to the sorcerer.
Henry Charles Lea|A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages|With the triumph of Christianity the circle of forbidden practices was enormously enlarged. A new sacred magic was introduced which superseded and condemned as sorcery and demon-worship a vast array of observances and beliefs, which had become an integral part and almost ineradicable part of daily life.
Henry Charles Lea|A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages|The awful words "Thou shall not suffer a witch (Mekasshepha) to live" have rung through the centuries, and have served as a justification for probably more judicial slaughter than any other sentence in the history of human jurisprudence.
Henry Charles Lea|A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages|Commencing with those accused of magic, it extended to all who were noted for letters or philosophy. Terror reigned throughout the East; all who had libraries burned them. [Eastern Empire, about 374 AD]

Leibniz|NULL|Ordinary languages, though mostly helpful for the inferences of thought, are yet subject to countless ambiguities and cannot do the task of a calculus, which is to expose mistakes in inference... This remarkable advantage is afforded up to date only by the symbols of arithmeticians and algebraists, for whom inference consists only in the use of characters, and a mistake in thought and in the calculus is identical.
Bernard Lewis|The Crisis of Islam|In Muslim tradition, the world is divided into two houses, the House of Islam, in which Muslim governments rule and Muslim law prevails, and the House of War, the rest of the world, still...ruled by infidels.
Bernard Lewis|The Crisis of Islam|If a Muslim renounces Islam, even if a new convert converts to his previous faith, the penalty is death.
Bernard Lewis|The Crisis of Islam|Yet the most powerful accusation of all is the degeneracy and debauchery of the American way of life, and the threat that it offers to Islam...This is what is meant by the term the Great Satan, applied to the United States by Ayatollah Khomeini. Satan as depicted in the Qu'ran is neither an imperialist nor an exploiter. He is a seducer, "the insidious tempter who whispers in the hearts of men."
Bernard Lewis|The Crisis of Islam|For Islamists, democracy, expressing the will of the people, is the road to power, but it is a one-way road...
Bernard Lewis|The Crisis of Islam|The Arab world translates about 330 books annually [2002], one fifth of the number that Greece translates. Spain translates almost 100,000 in one year.

James Lovelock|Gaia - A New Look at Life on Earth|It is an intriguing thought that without the assistance of those anaerobic microflora living in the stinking muds of the sea-beds, lakes, and ponds, there might be no reading or writing of books. Without the methane they produce, oxygen would rise inexorably in concentration to a level at which any fire would be a holocaust and land life, apart from the microflora in damp places, would be impossible.

James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|I find it sad, but all too human, that there are vast bureaucracies concerned with nuclear waste, huge organizations devoted to decommissioning nuclear power stations, but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste, carbon dioxide.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Few, even among climate scientists and ecologists, seem yet to realize fully the potential severity, or the immanence, of catastrophic global disaster; understanding is still in the conscious mind alone and not yet the visceral reaction of fear.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|We are no more qualified to be the stewards or developers of the Earth than are goats to be gardeners.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|Despite all these warnings, we carry on destroying and seem to worry only about the nearly trivial, even imaginary, risk of cancer from mobile telephones, power lines, pesticide residues in food, or sunlight; topping them all is a fear of anything to do with nuclear energy.
James Lovelock|The Revenge of Gaia|How on Earth, you may ask, can something so good, something so benign as nuclear energy have been demonized to the point where people and sensitive governments are frightened to use it? I think it is a consequence of the vulnerability of people to the astonishing power to deceive of an endlessly repeated falsehood.
Madame de Hausset|Mémoires|Everything in existence, said he, taking a handful of louis from his pocket, is contained in these little pieces of metal, which will convey you commodiously from one end of the world to the other.

Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|What a capital article of furniture an arm-chair is, and what a treasure to a thoughtful man! During the long winter evenings it is often delightful, and always prudent, to lounge luxuriously in it, far from the turmoil of the madding crowd. A good fire, books, and pens; what safeguards these are against ennui! And how pleasant again, to forget books and pens in the delights of stirring the fire, while giving one's-self up to some sweet thought, or making a few rhymes for the amusement of friends! The hours glide by and fall into silence - into eternity, without making their sad passage felt.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|The moment was short and full of ecstasy; cold reason soon resumed her sway, and in the twinkling of an eye, a whole year was added to my life; my heart grew icy cold, and I found myself on a level with the throng of commonplace beings who crowd the earth.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|Happy is he who finds a friend whose heart and mind are in sympathy with his own; a friend who is linked to him by similar tastes, feelings, and knowledge; a friend who is not tormented by ambition or egotism; who prefers the shade of a tree to the pomp of a court! Happy is he who possesses a friend!
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|We were happy in our errors, but now - ah! all is sadly changed. We have been compelled, like others, to read the human heart; and truth, falling like a bomb into the midst of us, has forever destroyed the enchanted palace of illusion.
Xavier de Maistre|A Journey Around My Room|From the expedition of the Argonauts to the Assembly of the Notables, from the nethermost Hell to the last fixed star of the Milky Way, to the confines of the Universe, to the gates of chaos, this is the vast expanse over the length and breadth of which I wander at leisure, for neither time nor space fail me.

Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|C'est un charme toujours nouveau pour moi que celui de contempler le ciel étoilé, et je n'ai pas à me reprocher d'avoir fait un seul voyage, ni même une simple promenade nocturne, sans payer le tribut d'admiration que je dois aux merveilles du firmament.
Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|Spectateur éphémère d'un spectacle éternel, l'homme lève un instant les yeux vers le ciel, et les referme pour toujours; mais, pendant cet instant rapide qui lui est accordé, de tous les points du ciel et depuis les bornes de l'univers, un rayon consolateur part de chaque monde et vient frapper ses regards, pour lui annoncer qu'il existe un rapport entre l'immensité et lui, et qu'il est associé à l'éternité.
Xavier de Maistre|Expédition nocturne autour de ma chambre|Combien peu de personnes, me disais-je, jouissent maintenant avec moi du spectacle sublime que le ciel étale inutilement pour les hommes assoupis!... Passe encore pour ceux qui dorment; mais qu'en coûterait-il à ceux qui se promènent, a ceux qui sortent en foule du théâtre de regarder un instant et d'admirer les brillantes constellations qui rayonnent de toutes parts sur leur tête? – Non, les spectateurs attentifs de Scapin ou de Jocrisse ne daigneront pas lever les yeux: Ils vont rentrer brutalement chez eux, ou ailleurs, sans songer que le ciel existe. Quelle bizarrerie!… parce qu'on peut le voir souvent et gratis, ils n'en veulent pas. Si le firmament était toujours voilé pour nous, si le spectacle qu'il nous offre dépendait d'un entrepreneur, les premières loges sur les toits seraient hors de prix, et les dames de Turin s'arracheraient ma lucarne.

B. Malinowski|Argonauts of the Western Pacific|Disease is not conceived as an extraneous force, coming from outside and settling on the man, it is directly a man-made, sorcerer-made something.
B. Malinowski|Argonauts of the Western Pacific|But each of the rites and spells is to the native mind, quite as indispensable for the success of the enterprise, as is the practical activity.
B. Malinowski|Argonauts of the Western Pacific|...natives communally, as well as individually, never act except on traditional and conventional lines.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|Yet when the sociologist approaches the study of magic, there where it still reigns supreme...he finds to his disappointment an entirely sober, prosaic, even clumsy art, enacted for purely practical reasons, governed by crude and shallow beliefs, carried out in a simple and monotonous technique. This was already indicated in the definition of magic given above when in order to distinguish it from religion we described it as a body of purely practical acts, performed as a means to an end.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|[Magic] remains from the earliest times in the hands of specialists, and the first profession of mankind is that of wizard or witch.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|To the natives, knowledge of magic means the knowledge of the spell; and in any act of witchcraft the ritual centers around the utterance of the spell.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|...anthropology should not only be the study of savage custom in the light of our mentality and our culture, but also the study of our own mentality in the distant perspective borrowed from Stone Age man.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|But there is no doubt whatever to him that all serious and especially all fatal illnesses are due to various forms and agencies of witchcraft.
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|Women and the suspicion of magical practices are the main causes of quarrels and village brawls...
B. Malinowski|Magic, Science, and Religion|It is in the spell that the main virtue of all magic resides. The rite is there only to launch the spell, to serve as an appropriate mechanism of transmission.

Philip Matyszak|24 Hours in Ancient Athens|The hetaira's ideal beau is young, good-looking, lavishly and unfailingly generous, intelligent and good-tempered. Sadly the species has been hunted to extinction, so hetairas compete viciously for any man with just two of the above qualities.

Guy de Maupassant|L'inutile beauté|Qu'y a-t-il, en effet, de plus ignoble, de plus répugnant que cet acte ordurier et ridicule de la reproduction des êtres, contre lequel toutes les âmes delicates sont et seront éternellement révoltées?
Guy de Maupassant|La Sicile|L'architecture est morte aujourd'hui, en ce siècle encore artiste, pourtant, mais qui semble avoir perdu le don de faire de la beauté avec des pierres, le mystérieux secret de la séduction par les lignes, le sens de la grâce dans les monuments. Nous paraissons ne plus comprendre, ne plus savoir que la seule proportion d'un mur peut donner à l'esprit la même sensation de joie artistique, la même émotion secrète et profonde qu'un chef-d'oeuvre de Rembrandt, de Velasquez ou de Véronèse.
Guy de Maupassant|La morte|Comme elle est petite cette ville à côté de l'autre, celle ou l'on vit! Et pourtant comme ils sont plus nombreux que les vivants, ces morts. Il nous faut de hautes maisons, des rues, tant de place, pour les quatre générations qui regardent le jour en même temps, boivent l'eau des sources, le vin des vignes et mangent le pain des plaines. Et pour toute les générations des morts, pour toute l'échelle de l'humanité descendue jusqu'à nous, presque rien, un champ, presque rien! La terre les reprend, l'oubli les efface. Adieu!
Guy de Maupassant|Les tombales|Et puis, j'aime aussi les cimetières, parce que ce sont des villes monstrueuses, prodigieusement habitées. Songez donc à ce qu'il y a de morts dans ce petit espace, à toutes les générations de Parisiens qui sont logés là, pour toujours, troglodytes définitifs enfermés dans leurs petits caveaux, dans leurs petits trous couverts d'une pierre ou marqués d'une croix, tandis que les vivants occupent tant de place et font tant de bruit, ces imbéciles.
Guy de Maupassant|Ma femme|J'avais trente-cinq ans, et je ne pensais pas plus à me marier qu'à me pendre.
Guy de Maupassant|Monsieur Parent|Les années se suivaient, lentes, monotones, et courtes parce qu'elles étaient vides.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|...elle consentit à épouser ce gros garçon très riche, qui n'était pas laid, mais qui ne lui plaisait guère, comme elle aurait consenti à passer un été dans un pays désagréable.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Ah!, vous ne comprenez pas, vous autres, comme c'est amusant, les affaires, non pas les affaires des marchands ou des commerçants, mais les grandes affaires, les nôtres! Oui, mon cher, quand on les entend bien, cela résume tout ce qu'ont aimé les hommes, c'est en même temps la politique, la guerre, la diplomatie, tout, tout! Il faut toujours chercher, trouver, inventer, tout comprendre, tout prévoir, tout combiner, tout oser. Le grand combat, aujourd'hui, c'est avec l'argent qu'on le livre.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|C'est bon, dit-il, d'être jeune, quelquefois.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Laissez donc, dit-il, je la connais, leur intelligence, à tous ces brasseurs d'affaires. Ils n'ont qu'une chose en tête : l'argent! Toutes les pensées que nous donnons aux belles choses, tous les actes que nous perdons pour nos caprices, toutes les heures que nous jetons à nos distractions, toute la force que nous gaspillons pour nos plaisirs, toute l'ardeur et toute la puissance que nous prend l'amour, l'amour divin, ils les emploient à chercher de l'or, à songer à l'or, à amasser de l'or! L'homme, l'homme intelligent, vit pour toutes les grandes tendresses désintéressées, les arts, l'amour, la science, les voyages, les livres; et s'il cherche l'argent, c'est parce que cela facilite les joies réelles de l'esprit et même le bonheur du cœur! Mais eux, ils n'ont rien dans l'esprit et dans le coeur que ce goût ignoble du trafic! Ils ressemblent aux hommes de valeur, ces écumeurs de la vie, comme le marchand de tableaux ressemble au peintre, comme l'éditeur ressemble à l'écrivain, comme le directeur de théâtre ressemble au poète.
Guy de Maupassant|Mont Oriol|Elle ne les vit pas, ou ne les reconnut point. Toute pâle sur son oreiller blanc, avec ses cheveux blonds répandus sur ses épaules, elle regardait, de ses clairs yeux bleus, le monde inconnu, mystérieux et fantastique où vivent les fous.
Guy de Maupassant|Notre Coeur|Mais les mots noirs sur le papier blanc, c'est l'âme toute nue.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|Les mots ont une âme.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|La profonde et délicieuse jouissance qui vous monte au coeur devant certaines pages, devant certaines phrases, ne vient pas seulement de ce qu'elles disent; elle vient d'une accordance absolue de l'expression avec l'idée, d'une sensation d'harmonie, de beauté secrète, échappant la plupart du temps au jugement des foules.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|Il [Flaubert] avait pour les grands écrivains français une admiration frénétique; il possédait par coeur des chapitres entiers des maîtres, et il les déclamait d'une voix tonnante, grisé par la prose, faisant sonner les mots, scandant, modulant, chantant la phrase.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|La misanthropie de ses oeuvres [Flaubert] ne vient pas d'autres chose. La saveur amère qui s'en degage n'est que cette constante constatation de la médiocrité, de la banalité, de la sottise sous toutes les formes.
Guy de Maupassant|Oeuvres posthumes|Elle sait pourtant qu'elle va mourir, qu'elle ne verra point le printemps, que dans un an, le long de la même promenade, ces mêmes gens qui passent devant elle viendront encore respirer l'air tiède de ce doux pays, avec leurs enfants un peu plus grands, avec le coeur toujours rempli d'espoirs, de tendresses, de bonheur, tandis qu'au fond d'un cercueil de chêne la pauvre chair que lui reste encore aujourd'hui sera tombée en pourriture, laissant seulement ses os couchés dans la robe de soie qu'elle a choisie pour linceul.
Guy de Maupassant|Qui sait?|Je ne refuse pas de voir le monde, de causer, de dîner avec des amis, mais lorsque je les sens depuis longtemps près de moi, même les plus familiers, ils me lassent, me fatiguent, m'énervent, et j'éprouve une envie grandissante, harcelante, de les voir partir ou de m'en aller, d'être seul.
Guy de Maupassant|Solitude|Quoi que nous tentions, quoi que nous fassions, quels que soient l'élan de nos coeurs, l'appel de nos lèvres et l'étreinte de nos bras, nous sommes toujours seuls.
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|Mais d'autres hommes, parcourant d'un éclair de pensée le cercle étroit des satisfactions possibles, demeurent atterrés devant le néant du bonheur, la monotonie et la pauvreté des joies terrestres.
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|O liberté! liberté! seul bonheur, seul espoir et seul rêve!
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|Certes, en certains jours, j'éprouve l'horreur de ce qui est jusqu'à désirer la mort. Je sens jusqu'à la souffrance suraiguë la monotonie invariable des paysages, des figures et des pensées. Le médiocrité de l'univers m'étonne et me révolte, la petitesse de toutes choses m'emplit de dégoût, la pauvreté des êtres humains m'anéantit.
Guy de Maupassant|Sur l'eau|Comme je l'aime, cette dédicace de Jules Vallès: «A tous ceux qui, nourris de grec et de latin, sont morts de faim.»
Guy de Maupassant|Une vie|Quelques pigeons se promenaient au bord du ruisseau, cherchant leur vie.
Guy de Maupassant|Â Vendre|Partir à pied, quand le soleil se lève, et marcher dans la rosée, le long des champs, au bord de la mer calme, quelle ivresse!
André Maurois|Climats|Les hommes livrent leur âme, comme les femme leur corps, par zones successives et bien défendues.
Ian McEwan|The Child in Time|Shakespeare would have grasped wave functions, Donne would have understood complementarity and relative time. They would have been excited. What richness! They would have plundered this new science for their imagery. And they would have educated their audiences too. But you 'arts' people, you're not only ignorant of these magnificent things, you're rather proud of knowing nothing.
F. Meinke|The German Catastrophe|Hitler, one may say, come to power through a typical but dazzled and blinded youth movement.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|One person who has mastered life is better than a thousand persons who have mastered only the contents of books.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|The just are they that take everything alike from God no matter what it is, big and little, good and bad, all the same, no more no less, but one thing like another.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|Turning and change lead nowhere; stopping, we progress.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|The soul is motionless when nothing whatever can perturb her, when she is neither glad nor sad and cannot be gladdened nor yet saddened, and when she has no need to cling to any creature.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|Man's best chance of finding God is where he left him.
Meister Eckhart|NULL|I must let virtue go if I would see God face to face.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head.

Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|...I never fancied broiling fowls; - though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
Herman Melville|Moby Dick|Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
H. L. Mencken|The American Scene|In the field of language an Americanism is generally regarded as obnoxious em(ipso facto), and when a new one of any pungency begins to force its way into English usage the guardians of the national linguistic chastity belabor it with great vehemence, and predict calamitous consequences if it is not put down.
H. L. Mencken|The American Scene|em(Damn) is a simple verb and its only child is a simple adjective, but em(hell) ranges over all the keys of the grammatical scale and enters into combinations as avidly as oxygen.
H. L. Mencken|The American Scene|That leveling, by the democratic theory, is upward, but in actuality it is downward, for the mob suspects and resents superiorities, whereas inferiorities give it a pleasant glow.
H. L. Mencken|The American Scene|He liked people who sweated freely, and were not debauched by the refinements of the toilet.
Stephen Miller|Conversation - A History of a Declining Art|The point is: one should try to enjoy the conversible world, despite its inanities, because removing oneself from it is dangerous to one's mental health.
Leonard Mlodinow|The Drunkard's Walk|When chance is involved, people's thought processes are often seriously flawed.
Leonard Mlodinow|The Drunkard's Walk|We habitually underestimate the effect of randomness.
Leonard Mlodinow|The Drunkard's Walk|Complete chaos is ironically a kind of perfection.
Leonard Mlodinow|The Drunkard's Walk|Avoiding the illusion of meaning in random patterns is a difficult task.
Leonard Mlodinow|The Drunkard's Walk|...we should learn to spend as much time looking for evidence that we are wrong as we spend searching for reasons we are correct.
Mme la Marquise de la Rochejaquelein|Mémoires|MM. de Feu et de Richeteau, qui, à la suite de quelques pourparlers, avaient la veille consenti à rester en otage, furent aussi massacrés. Des gardes nationales de la plaine retournèrent dans leurs foyers, emportant comme trophées, au bout de leurs baïonnettes, des nez, des oreilles et des lambeaux de chair humaine.

Mme la Marquise de la Rochejaquelein|Mémoires|Madame de Jourdain fut menée sur la Loire pour être noyée avec ses trois filles: un soldat voulut sauver la plus jeune, qui était fort belle; elle se jeta à l'eau pour partager le sort de sa mère: la malheureuse enfant tomba sur des cadavres, et n'enfonça point; elle criait: «Poussez-moi! je n'ai pas assez d'eau!» et elle périt.

L'Abbé Morellet|Mémoires|"Oh! diable", dit M. de Buffon, la tête haute, les yeux à demi fermés, et avec un air moitié niais, moitié inspiré, "oh! diable! quand il est question de clarifier son style, c'est une autre paire de manches." A ce propos, à cette comparaison des rues, voilà Mlle de l'Espinasse qui se trouble; sa physionomie s'altère, elle se renverse sur son fauteil, répétant entre ses dents, "une autre paire de manches! clarifier son style!" Elle n'en revint pas de toute la soirée.
L'Abbé Morellet|Mémoires|C'était des harangues de sections, et puis l'hymne des Marseillais, et puis des chansons à plusieurs couplets sur des airs d'opéra-comique...que le président Lubin, orné de son écharpe, chantait hors de mesure avec une voix et des gréments et des manières du beau Léandre, qui ravissait les spectateurs...Je crois bien que le président chanta ainsi en em(solo) à peu près trois quarts d'heure en différentes fois, l'assemblé répétant communément le dernier vers du couplet. Aussi une femme du peuple, qui attendait comme moi dans cette antichambre, disait: "Mais c'est drôle de passer comme ça tout le temps de leur assemblé à chanter; est-ce qu'ils sont là pour ça?"
L'Abbé Morellet|Mémoires|Enfin, cette nation et cette ville ont vu et souffert une assemblé nationale ou se disant telle qui, chargés de défendre les propriétés, les libértes, les vies des Français, ordonnait ces horreurs, tandis que les moins coupables d'entre eux n'opposaient aucune résistance à ces lois de sang. Ce phénomène n'est pas encore expliqué, si même il est explicable.
Christopher Morley|Parnassus on Wheels|There is no hope for New Yorkers, for they glory in their skyscraping sins; but in Brooklyn there is the wisdom of the lowly.

John Morressy|A Tale of Three Wizards|The Harkeners were peaceful folk who devoted their lives to listening for instructive and consolatory voices from another plane. Since no one could be certain where such voices might best be heard, Harkeners listened to everything: old boots, haystacks, boulders, trees, bowls of oatmeal, and anything else at hand... Belsheer thought that over, and his expression brightened. "It would be nice to spend a few weeks sitting in the sun, listening to a loaf of bread."
Mother Theresa|NULL|The biggest disease in the world today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted, uncared for, and deserted by everybody.
John Murphy|NULL|Every so often a disappearance is in order. A vanishing. A checking out. An indeterminate period of unavailability.
Douglas Murray|The Madness of Crowds|...the current way of regarding women is the same as men, but different where it's useful or flattering.
Douglas Murray|The Madness of Crowds|[The concept of patriarchy] has become so ingrained that when it is mentioned it now floats by as though the idea that Western societies are centred around - and run solely for the comfort of - men is not even something that most people would bother to dispute.
Douglas Murray|The Madness of Crowds|...defining an entire group of people, their attitudes, pitfalls, and moral associations, based solely on their racial characteristics is itself a fairly good demonstration of racism.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|...if there is a bit more beheading and sexual assault than there used to be in Europe, then at least we also benefit from a much wider range of cuisines.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|Thus the states that had been so open and liberal that they had allowed and encouraged large-scale migration were portrayed as countries which were uniquely racist.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|Within less than 24 hours Rushdie was in hiding, with protection provided by the British state. Soon thousands of British Muslims were on the streets supporting the imposition of Islamic blasphemy laws in Britain.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|Asked whether he [Cat Stevens] would go to a demonstration where an effigy of Rushdie was being burnt, he replied, "I would have hoped that it would be the real thing."
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|...on Bastille Day 2014, worshippers at a synagogue in Paris were barricaded inside by immigrant protesters chanting, among other things, "Death to the Jews"...
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|What mainstream politicians and much of the media had in fact done, right up to and througout the 2000s, was encourage a sense that the people in Europe who were shouting "fire" were the actual arsonists.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|Despite being illegal for three decades, and despite more than 130,000 women in Britain having suffered this barbaric treatment [of female genital mutilation], there still have been no successful persecutions of the crime.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|By 2015 Sweden had the highest level of rapes per capita of any country in the world after Lesotho.
Douglas Murray|The Strange Death of Europe|This is why by 2015 more British Muslims were fighting for Isis than for the British Armed forces.
Douglas Murray|The War on the West|People began to talk of "equality", but they did not seem to care about equal rights. They talked of "anti-racism", but they sounded deeply racist. They spoke of "justice", but they seemed to mean revenge.
Douglas Murray|The War on the West|This logical trap is the same one favored by witch-dunkers in the Middle Ages: if the woman drowns, she is innocent; if she floats, she's a witch and can be burned. In DiAngelo's logic, the person who denies they are a racist is racist, and so is the person who says they are racist.
Douglas Murray|The War on the West|The bell in question was held under suspicion for having once been on a slave plantation, and so it was "shuttered off" from public view pending further investigations into the inanimate object. At such moments, you can begin to wonder whether we are getting into the realm of Narnia-like magic.

Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|The issue is not indifference to established knowledge; it's the emergence of a positive em(hostility) to such knowledge.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|Americans no longer distinguish the phrase "you're wrong" from "you're stupid". To disagree is to disrespect. To correct another is to insult.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|College students may not be dumber than they were thirty years ago, but their sense of entitlement and their unfounded self-confidence have grown considerably.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|"Well," the student said, "your guess is as good as mine." [Robert] Jastrow stopped the young man short. "No, no, no" he said emphatically. "em(My) guesses are much, em(much) better than yours."
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|When feelings matter more than rationality or facts, education is a doomed enterprise. Emotion is an unassailable defense against expertise, a moat of anger and resentment in which reason and knowledge quickly drown. And when students learn that emotion trumps everything else, it is a lesson they will take with them for the rest of their lives.
Tom Nichols|The Death of Expertise|To faculty everywhere, the lesson was obvious: the campus of a top university is not a place for intellectual exploration. It is a luxury home, rented for four to six years, nine months at a time, by children of the elite who may shout at faculty as if they're berating clumsy maids in a colonial mansion.

Brendan O'Neill|After the Pogrom|There were two eruptions of barbarism in October 2023. The first was Hamas's pogrom of 7 October, in which more than a thousand people were slaughtered and many others were maimed, raped, and kidnapped. The second was the sympathy for the pogrom across much of the Western world.
Brendan O'Neill|After the Pogrom|We can no longer ignore the fact that even the worst act of violence against the Jews since the Holocaust was not enough to awaken the West to the threat posed by radical Islam - not only to the Jewish State, but also to the West itself.
Brendan O'Neill|After the Pogrom|No, all that matters is the scapegoating of Israel for the supposed crimes of modernity. The transformation of Israel into the sin-eater of Western culture.
Brendan O'Neill|After the Pogrom|Decolonisation is decivilisation. It is a purge. It is the purging of our institutions of the ideas and ideals that shaped our societies. It is a secular jihad.

Those who called themselves patriots regarded it as against the fundamental principles of liberty to correct children.

Léon Poliakov|Harvest of Hate|"Today I am going to play the prophet again. If international Jewry should succeed, in Europe or elsewhere, in precipitating nations into a world war, the result will be not the bolshevization of Europe and a victory for Judaism, but the extermination in Europe of the Jewish race." [Hitler's annual speech, 1939-01-30]
Léon Poliakov|Harvest of Hate|Another amusement consisted of breaking into a Jewish apartment or house and forcing young and old to undress and dance, arm in arm, to the sound of a phonograph. Following this with rape was optional, as one risked being tried for the "crime of race defilement". Staider spirits, combining business and pleasure, seized pedestrian Jewesses in the street in order to make them clean their quarters or barracks (business) with the victim's underwear (pleasure).

Léon Poliakov|The History of Anti-Semitism|Emicho and all his men, having taken counsel, proceeded at sunrise to attack the Jews with lances and axes... Having broken the locks and knocked in the doors, they seized and killed seven hundred who vainly sought to defend themselves against forces far superior to their own; the women were also massacred, and the young children, whatever their sex, were put to the sword. The Jews, seeing the Christians rise as enemies against them and their children, with no respect for the weakness of age, took arms in turn against their coreligionists, against their wives, their children, their mothers, and their sisters, and massacred their own. A horrible thing to tell of - the mothers seized the sword and cut the throats of the children at their breast, choosing to destroy themselves at their own hands rather than succomb to the blows of the uncircumcised!

Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|In Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|Think of Richard Nixon, or Jimmy Carter, or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein's case, a photograph of a face). Of words, nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter, but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue entirely.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|It is not merely that, on the television screen, entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesized its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcotized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil's observation that "television is the soma of Aldous Huxley's em(Brave New World)". Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice; we watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens, or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk... then culture-death is a clear possibility.
Neil Postman|Amusing Ourselves To Death|Public consciousness has not yet assimilated the point that technology is ideology...
Neil Postman|Technopoly|Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, and takes its orders from technology.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|It's a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|I will go further: in Technopoly, all experts are invested with the charisma of priestliness.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|I am constantly amazed at how obediently people accept explanations that begin with the words "the computer shows..." or "the computer has determined..." It is Technopoly's equivalent of the sentence "It is God's will.", and the effect is roughly the same.
Neil Postman|Technopoly|The Technopoly story is without a moral centre. It puts in its place efficiency, interest, and economic advance.

Marcel Proust|Albertine disparue|Car il y a dans ce monde où tout s'use, où tout périt, une chose qui tombe en ruines, qui se détruit encore plus complètement, en laissant encore moins de vestiges que la Beauté: c'est le Chagrin.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Quand d'un passé ancien rien ne subsiste, après la mort des êtres, après la destruction des choses seules, plus frêles mais plus vivaces, plus immatérielles, plus persistantes, plus fidèles, l'odeur et la saveur restent encore longtemps, comme des âmes, à se rappeler, à attendre, à espérer, sur la ruine de tout le reste, à porter sans fléchir, sur leur gouttelette presque impalpable, l'édifice immense du souvenir.
Marcel Proust|Du côté du chez Swann|Quand, plus tard, j'ai eu l'occasion de rencontrer, au cours de ma vie, dans des couvents par exemple, des incarnations vraiment saintes de la charité active, elles avaient généralement un air allègre, positif, indifférent et brusque de chirurgien pressé, ce visage où ne se lit aucune commisération, aucun attendrissement devant la souffrance humaine, aucune crainte de la heurter, et qui est le visage sans douceur, le visage antipathique et sublime de la vraie bonté.

Mme Verdurin, souffrant pour ses migraines de ne plus avoir de croissant à tremper dans son café au lait, avait obtenu de Cottard une ordonnance qui lui permettait de s'en faire faire dans certain restaurant dont nous avons parlé. Cela avait été presque aussi difficile à obtenir des pouvoirs publics que la nomination d'un général. Elle reprit son premier croissant le matin où les journaux narraient le naufrage du Lusitania. Tout en trempant le croissant dans le café au lait et donnant des pichenettes à son journal pour qu'il pût se tenir grand ouvert sans qu'elle eût besoin de détourner son autre main des trempettes, elle disait : «Quelle horreur! Cela dépasse en horreur les plus affreuses tragédies.» Mais la mort de tous ces noyés ne devait lui apparaître que réduite au milliardième, car tout en faisant, la bouche pleine, ces réflexions désolées, l'air qui surnageait sur sa figure, amené probablement là par la saveur du croissant, si précieux contre la migraine, était plutôt celui d'une douce satisfaction.

Marcel Proust|Le temps retrouvé|Depuis le jour de l'escalier, rien du monde, aucun bonheur, qu'il vînt de l'amitié des gens, des progrès de mon œuvre, de l'espérance de la gloire, ne parvenait plus à moi que comme un si pâle soleil qu'il n'avait plus la vertu de me réchauffer, de me faire vivre, de me donner un désir quelconque, et encore était-il trop brillant, si blême qu'il fût, pour mes yeux qui préféraient se fermer, et je me retournais du côté du mur.

Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognized that large handwriting in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon ill-formed characters, suggestive, perhaps, to less biased eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, or a want of sincerity and will-power.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened at that moment to extinguish every particle of light in his brain.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress of which he had been so imprudent as to point out to her the delights, every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his torture chamber.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Let's hope she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a whole fortnight with a woman who takes about as much interest in music as a tone-deaf newt - that would be fun!

Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|But the harshness of his steely gaze was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat.
Marcel Proust|Swann's Way|Swann speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests.

Marcel Proust|The Guermantes Way|...I was not really there; my mind stayed behind somewhere else and sent mere Habit to take its place.

Marcel Proust|The Guermantes Way|And, indeed, I ought to have guessed this from her way of smiling, for I had already observed this sort of behavior when I saw the Princess of Luxembourg buying rye-bread rolls on the beach in Balbec to give to my grandmother, as though to a deer at the zoo.

Marcel Proust|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs|Mais avant tout j'avais ouvert mes rideaux dans l'impatience de savoir qu'elle était la Mer qui jouait ce matin-là au bord du rivage, comme une Néréïde. Car chacune de ces Mers ne restait jamais plus qu'un jour. Le lendemain il y en avait une autre qui parfois lui ressemblait. Mais je ne vis jamais deux fois la même.

Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|It has always, therefore, been my custom not to tie myself down to universal or general rules... For rules are rarely of such a kind that their validity cannot be shaken and overthrown in some particular or other.
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|If therefore we have received no fairer gift from heaven than speech, what shall we regard as so worthy of laborious cultivation, or in what should we sooner desire to excel our fellow-men, than that in which humanity excels all other living things?
Quintilian|Institutio Oratorio|Style has three kinds of excellence: correctness, lucidity, and elegance.

Laurence Rees|Hitler and Stalin|"Ninety-nine percent of the German people have turned off thinking for themselves," wrote civil servant Friedrich Kellner, a critic of the regime, in his diary in July 1940.
Laurence Rees|Hitler and Stalin|"I think that real life is hunger, and the rest is a mirage," wrote the Leningrad scholar Dmitry Likhachev. "In the time of famine people revealed themselves, stripped themselves, freed themselves of all trumpery.

Laurence Rees|Hitler and Stalin|One estimate is that 50,000 women were raped in the capital, and more across the rest of the country. [Budapest, taken by the Soviets]

Laurence Rees|Hitler and Stalin|No one can ever know exactly how many women were raped by the Soviet conquerors. It's possible, however, that nearly two million women and girls in Germany alone endured this horror during the war and its immediate aftermath.

Mme Roland|Mémoires|Sous le tranquil abri du toit paternel, j'étais heureuse dès l'enfance avec des fleurs et des livres: dans l'étroite enceinte d'une prison, au milieu des fers imposés par la tyrannie la plus révoltante, j'oublie l'injustice des hommes, leurs sottises et mes maux, avec des livres et des fleurs.
Mme Roland|Mémoires|Enfin, je ne me suis mariée qu'à vingt-cinq ans, et avec une ame telle qu'on peut la présumer, des sens très-inflammables, beaucoup d'instruction sur divers objets; j'avais si bien évité l'instruction sur certain autre, que les événemens du mariage me parurent aussi surprenans que désagréables.
Mme Roland|Mémoires|A quatorze ans, comme aujourd'hui, j'avais environs cinq pieds; ma taille avait acquis toute sa croissance; la jambe bien faite, le pied bien posé, les hanches très-relevées; la poitrine large et superbement meublée...
Mme Roland|Mémoires|...madame de Roudé, par exemple, qui, malgré son âge, aimait encore à faire belle gorge, et portait toujours la sienne à découvert, excepté lorsqu'elle montait en voiture, ou qu'elle en déscendait; car elle la cachait alors d'un grand mouchoir qu'elle tenait à sa poche dans cette intention, parce que, disait-elle, cela n'est pas fait pour montrer à des laquais.
Mme Roland|Mémoires|«Mon père, je m'accuse... - Eh bien!» Que dire après? Le coeur me battait, le feu me montait au visage; certaine sueur se répandait partout: «Je m'accuse... d'avoir eu des mouvemens contraires à la chasteté chrétienne.» Ah! La bonne phrase!
Mme Roland|Mémoires|I feel my resolution to pursue these memories deserting me. The miseries of my country torment me; an involuntary gloom penetrates my soul, chilling my imagination. France has become a vast Golgotha of carnage, an arena of horrors, where her children tear and destroy one another...

Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|At eight o'clock on the morning of May 14, the British lowered the Union Jack on Jerusalem. By mid-afternoon full-scale fighting had erupted throughout the country.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|In April and May [1948], entire Arab communities were fleeing in terror even before Jewish forces overran their homes. A Swiss observer, Jacques de Reynier, described the panic among the inhabitants of Jaffa when the Jews attacked: "Immediately everyone was consumed with terror, and soon the evacuation started. In the haspitals, the drivers of cars and ambulances took their vehicles, assembled their families, and fled in complete disregard of their responsibilities. Many of the ill, nurses, even physicians, departed the hospital wearing the clothes they had on, and fled to the countryside. For all of them the one obsession was to escape at any cost.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|Between 1948 and 1957, as a consequence of government pressure, economic strangulation, and physical pogroms, some 467,000 Jews would be compelled to flee their ancestral homes in Moslem lands. The largest number of them would find asylum in Israel.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|In March 1950, therefore, the Iraqi parliament gave official sanction to Jewish emigration, on condition that Jews applying for exit permits relinquish their Iraqi citizenship. As an inducement for departure, the government assured prospective immigrants that the homes, businesses, and bank accounts they left behind would be disposed of legally, and that eventually they would receive the proceeds. Yet on March 10, 1951, one day following the deadline for exit registration, the government suddenly announced that the property and bank accounts of emigrating Jews henceforth were forfeited to the government.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|Psychologically, most important of all, the Arabs simply could not bring themselves to admit defeat at the hands of the "Zionist gangs." The Moslem tradition of jihad - of unceasing warfare against infidel interlopers - played a role here. Pride and self-esteem were equally critical factors, however. Once signed, the peace treaties would have been admission that the game was over. Azzam Pasha put the matter forthrightly: "We have a secret weapon which we can use better than guns and machine guns, and this is time. As long as we do not make peace with the Zionists, the war is not over; and as long as the war is not over, there is neither victor nor vanquished."
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|Indeed, as they turned to new modes of warfare, it became clear that they were obsessed above all with the advantages to be derived in casting a shadow in the world, from drawing attention to Palestine Arab identity.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|In Syria, the circumstances of the country's 3,500 remaining Jews were an unalleviated nightmare...In 1973 and 1974 there were episodes of Jewish girls raped and murdered at the hands of the Syrian police.
Howard Sachar|A History of Israel|On January 27, 1969, nine Jews were among fourteen prisoners hanged as "spies" in Baghdad's Liberation Square; crowds estimated at 200,000 marched past the dangling corpses, as the onlookers were treated to a running loudspeaker commentary on Jewish "treason."

Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|Today, public life has also become a matter of formal obligation. Most citizens approach their dealings with the state in a spirit of resigned acquiescence, but this public enervation is in its scope much broader than political affairs. Manners and ritual interchanges with strangers are looked on as at best formal and dry, at worst as phony. The stranger himself is a threatening figure, and few people can take great pleasure in that world of strangers, the cosmopolitan city.
Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|Behaving with strangers in an emotionally satisfying way and yet remaining aloof from them was seen by the mid-18th century as the means by which the human animal was transformed into a social being.
Richard Sennett|The Fall of Public Man|During the 19th century the family came to appear less and less the center of a particular, non-public region, more an idealized refuge, a world all its own, with a higher moral value than the public realm.

Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|The most cherished goal in physics, as in bad romance novels, is unification.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|To be fair, we have made two experimental discoveries in the past few decades: that neutrinos have mass and that the universe is dominated by a mysterious dark energy that seems to be accelerating its expansion.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|On the other hand, if string theorists are wrong, they can't be just a little wrong. If the new dimensions and symmetries do not exist, then we will count string theorists among science's greatest failures, like those who continued to work on Ptolemaic epicycles while Kepler and Galileo forged ahead. Theirs will be a cautionary tale of how not to do science, how not to let theoretical conjecture get so far beyond the limits of what can rationally be argued that one starts engaging in fantasy.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|Some people need to think through everything very carefully, and this takes time, as they get easily confused. It's not hard to feel superior to such people, until you remember that Einstein was one of them.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|What is remarkable to me is the number of distinguished scientists who seem unable to accept the possibility either that string theory or the hypothesis of a random multiverse is wrong.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|...it is not good for any field if any one person's views are taken too authoritatively. There is no scientist, not even Newton or Einstein, who was not wrong on a substantial number of issues they had strong views about.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|If your ideas are right and you fight for them, you'll accomplish something... No one but you can develop your ideas, and no one but you will fight for them.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|But what is equally important, and sobering, is how often we fool ourselves. And we fool ourselves not only individually but en masse. The tendency of a group of human beings to quickly come to believe something that its individual members will later see as obviously false is truly amazing.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|Feyerabend insisted that scientists should never agree, unless they are forced to.
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|If a highly disciplined subject like physics is vulnerable to the symptoms of groupthink, what may be happening in other, less rigorous areas?
Lee Smolin|The Trouble With Physics|[String theorists] seem to feel that appeal to consensus within their community is equivalent to rational argument.

As soon as I sat down, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case, return'd them and the book into his pocket altogether. I half rose up, and made him a bow. Translate this into any civilized language in the world, the sense is this: "Here's a poor stranger come in to the box; he seems as if he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose - 'tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely, in his face - and using him worse than a German."

L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science|[Quoting E. A. Wallis Budge] The belief in magic influenced [Egyptian] minds...from the earliest date to the latest period in their history...in a manner which, at this stage in the history of the world, is very difficult to comprehend.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science|[Quoting Breasted:] It is difficult for the modern mind to understand how completely the belief in magic penetrated the whole substance of life, dominating popular custom and constantly appearing in the simplest acts of the daily household routine, as much a matter of course as sleep or the preparation of food.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science|But Pliny himself feels that the assertions of the books of magic are fantastic, exaggerated, and untrue. He repeatedly brands the em(magi) or magicians as fools or impostors, and their statements as absurd and impudent tissues of lies.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science|It has often been remarked that, as a new religion comes to prevail in a society, the old rites are discredited and prohibited as magic. The faith and ceremonies of the majority, performed publicly, are called religion; the discarded cult, now practiced only privately and covertly by a majority, is stigmatized as magic and contrary to the general good.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science|The life of reason alone is free from magic.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.6|If our account seems cursory, this is partly because such works are so mystical and cloudy that a definite exposition of their contents is difficult, and that one dares not care to stand for long on the quicksands of their reveries.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.6|Here we may notice the plucking or digging of magic herbs at a given time with certain ceremonies, or the curing of toothache by saying "Anasageus" thrice, touching the aching tooth with a spear, and driving the spear into the the pavement of the baptistery.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.7|...and on the bite of the tarantula, a poison supposed to operate on anniversaries of the original puncturing and to be relieved only by dancing to certain music.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.8|[Quoting Lord Keynes:] [Isaac Newton was] the last of the magicians.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.8|[Quoting Caspar Batholinus:] No other quality more deserves the name of occult than gravity.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.8|Boyle himself told further of a man who had wasted away to a mere skeleton but recovered by hard-boiling an egg in his own urine, punching the egg-shell full of holes, and burying it in an anthill.
L. Thorndike|History of Magic and Experimental Science v.8|This extremely learned and virtuous man [Jean Filesac] in 1609 had published a treatise on Idolatrous Magic, in which he asserted that the transportation of witches to nocturnal sabbats had been so thoroughly proved by the most erudite of men of the age, that, if anyone any longer cherished any doubt about it, he should be judged not only a wanderer from the Christian faith and religion but as sadly deficient in reason and judgement.
Paul Tillich|NULL|By its nature, the metropolis provides what otherwise could be given only by traveling; namely, the strange.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|And so the liberal tendency became a habit with Stepan Arkadyich, and he liked his newspaper, as he liked his cigar after dinner, for the slight haze it produced in his head.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|The conversation never flagged for a minute, so that the old princess, who, in case a topic was lacking, always kept two heavy cannon in reserve - classical versus modern education, and general military conscription - did not have to move them up...
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|...but Vronsky went on looking at him as at a lamppost, and the young man grimaced, feeling that he was losing his self-possession under the pressure of this non-recognition of himself as a human being.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|It showed him the eternal error people make in imagining that happiness is the realization of desires.
Leo Tolstoy|Anna Karenina|There are no conditions to which a person cannot grow accustomed, especially if he sees that everyone around him lives in the same way.
Leo Tolstoy|Hadji Murad|All this was as it should be, because the welfare and happiness of the whole world depended on him, and wearied though he was, he would still not refuse the universe his assistance.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|...the nakedness of woman already tormented me. The hours I spent alone were not pure ones.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|It's really quite remarkable how complete the illusion is that beauty is the same as goodness.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|A honeymoon is an embarrassing, shameful, loathsome, pathetic business, and most of all it is tedious, unbearably tedious! It is something similar to what I experienced when I was learning how to smoke. I felt like vomiting, my saliva flowed, but I swallowed it and pretended I was enjoying myself.
Leo Tolstoy|The Kreutzer Sonata|In town a man can live for a hundred years and never notice that he's long dead and buried. There's never any time to study your conscience; you're busy all the time.
Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|Unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity.
Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.
Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with some difficulty.

Leo Tolstoy|War and Peace|Count Rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct.
Toulmin and Goodfield|The Architecture of Matter|The change-over from a developmental to a static conception of matter was as profound as the change from a geocentric to a heliocentric astronomy, and its effects were as far-reaching.
Toulmin and Goodfield|The Fabric of the Heavens|Yet ideas cannot be burned at the stake as heretics can.
Toulmin and Goodfield|The Fabric of the Heavens|For Galileo still thought of "inertial motion" as naturally circular, whether in the case of a ship moving over the Earth's surface, or in that of a satellite circling around the planet Jupiter.
Toulmin and Goodfield|The Fabric of the Heavens|It says much for Newton's mathematical facility...that he engaged in the whole enterprise as though it were an intellectual pastime, while believing all the time that the questions of true importance lay in other, religious directions.
Toulmin and Goodfield|The Fabric of the Heavens|Leibniz would have said that the term "field" was only a way of making Newton's miracles computable.
H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|In the sixteenth century the witch gradually replaces the Jew, and in the seventeenth century the reversal is almost complete. If the universal scapegoat of the Black Death in Germany had been the Jew, the universal scapegoat of the Wars of Religion will be the witch.
H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|When [the Malleus Maleficarum, "Hammer of Witches"] was published, it carried on its title-page the bold epigraph, "To disbelieve in witchcraft is the greatest of heresies." It was the exact opposite of the ruling of the Church in the Dark Ages. Since the 9th century, the wheel had come full circle.
H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|Romances of chivalry could be laughed out of existence, but no Don Quixote dared to kill, by ridicule, the bizarre novellettes which the grave lawyers and divines of all Europe published about Satan's kingdom.
H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|The law of God was stated most explicitly in Exodus 22-18: 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'
H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|By law, children who were said to have attended their mother to the sabbat were merely flogged in front of the fire in which their parent was burning.

H. R. Trevor-Roper|The European Witch-Craze|The last legal execution [of a witch] was in Protestant Glarus, in Switzerland, in 1782.

Chögyam Trungpa|NULL|The attainment of enlightenment from ego's point of view is extreme death, the death of self, the death of me and mine, the death of the watcher. It is the ultimate and final disappointment. Treading the spiritual path is painful. It is a constant unmasking, peeling off layer after layer of masks. It involves insult after insult.

C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|Writing was invented in order to record business activities in the early Near East.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|The end of the wooden or reed stylus, which struck the clay first, made a wider mark than the shaft, and so came into being the typical wedge-shaped impressions after which this writing system became know - cuneiform, from the Latin word em(cuneus) meaning wedge.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|Thus it is beginning to look as if we should think in terms of the invention of writing as being a gradual process, accomplished over a wide area, rather than the product of a single Sumerian genius.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|Eighty-five percent of the tablets from the early levels at Uruk are economic and are concerned with the income and outgoings of the city's temples in terms of food, livestock, and textiles...Fifteen percent of the texts are lexical lists, including the names of various commodities, animals, and officials.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|In some respects the Sumerian script never quite escapes from the fact that it was originally designed for the purpose of practical book-keeping rather than to express abstract ideas.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|As in other Semitic languages, Akkadian words basically have a root of three consonants, e.g. em(prs), which is then modified internally by the doubling of consonants or insertion of vowels, and externally by the addition of prefixes or postfixes, e.g. em(iprus), em(purus), em(iparrasuni).
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|The number of distinct cuneiform signs in use from the late third millenium onwards is about six hundred...
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon I, and high priestess of the moon-god Nanna at Ur, is one of the few female scribes known from Mesopotamia, and the earliest named author in history.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|The scribes often describe themselves simply as dubsar, but sometimes give themselves other titles such as...'junior scribe',...or 'exorcist'.
C. B. F. Walker|Cuneiform|...if one digs in a town of the Old Babylonian period it seems that one can find a few tablets in almost every house.

Walt Whitman|Song of Myself|And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times, and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero, and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe, and I say to any man or woman, let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.
