Quotations collected over a lifetime of reading.
In the Renaissance, such a book was sometimes called a book of common-places.

# Source file: quotes.txt 
Structured data file, UTF-8 encoding, typed in manually.
No repeated data.
The source file uses these ad hoc symbols to denote the need for special processing of the text:
- pre(...) is meant to preserve white space 
- em(...) is meant for emphasis/italics

# Derived files

I have code that talks to the above source file, and generates a PDF, suitable for printing.
That code is not included here. Only the data is included here. 
However, I do include the output of the code, as derived files.

## quotes_flat_file.txt 
This repeats data (author name, title). One quote per line.


## Pdf files
Final output as a PDF.
The PDF can be used to print a book at reasonable cost.
See, for example, lulu.com.
