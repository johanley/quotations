Quotations collected over a lifetime of reading.
I write quotations down while reading a good book.
I have several thousand collected in binders.
The quotes saved in this repo are my favourites.

# Source file: quotes.txt 
Structured data file, UTF-8 encoding, typed in manually.
No repeated data.
The source file uses *ad hoc* symbols to denote the need for special processing of the text:
- *pre*(...) is meant to preserve white space (lines of poetry)
- *em*(...) is meant for emphasis/italics

# Derived files

I have code that talks to the above source file, and generates a PDF, suitable for printing.
That code is not included here. Only the data is included here. 
However, I do include the output of the code, as two derived files.

## quotes_flat_file.txt 
This repeats data (author name, title). One quote per line.

## quotes_book.pdf
Final output as a printable PDF.
The PDF can be printed in book form.
See, for example, [lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/john-ohanley/and-i-quote/hardcover/product-1jw5jmgp.html).
